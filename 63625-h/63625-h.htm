<p class="bold2">BROKEN BUTTERFLIES</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>The black bow of the <i>Tenyo Maru</i> cut into the broad ribbon of
moonlight stretching, interminably, straight into the vast spaces
of the opalescent night. Somewhere ahead, bathed in that same pale
illumination, invisible, lay Japan.</p>

<p>Arms folded over the rail, Hugh Kent looked forward into the opaque
dimness. From the main deck below the plaint of a bamboo flute came
softly up to him. The following wind brought stray bits of the dance
music from astern where the cabin passengers were enjoying their last
night at sea. Ahead the Orient, dim, mysterious, indefinitely veiled as
the flute notes&mdash;behind him the virile, strident, restless clamor of
the West; ever approaching, the two, East and West, seeking to blend,
even partly blending, yet each as yet too strongly individual, mutually
strange, to combine in full harmony.</p>

<p>The vastness of space, vagueness of translucent darkness, shimmer of
niveous sparkle of foam cascaded before the tall prow and glimmer of
phosphorescence flickering in the dark water below, all induced to
introspection, reflection, vague wonder as to what lay before him, what
new revelations would life in Japan bring to him.</p>

<p>It had surely changed vastly in the score of years which had passed
since he had left it, at fifteen. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> would find much that he knew
though, would enjoy recapturing fluency in the speech which he had
prattled expertly as a toddler in amah's care and as a boy in the
streets and gardens of Kyoto. It would be a new, a more sophisticated
Japan that he would see, spoiled without doubt; still how he had longed
for years to return, to rediscover.</p>

<p>A shadow fell over his thoughts. How he had cherished that dream, a
few years ago, during the first years of their marriage, to go there
with Isabel. How they had both looked forward to it, to the time when
he should attain a post as correspondent at Tokyo for one of the great
dailies, to which his knowledge of the language gave him good reason
to aspire. Even after the first years of marriage had passed, when in
time they had gradually drifted apart, had become almost indifferent,
he had hoped that when Japan should provide a new scene for their
lives, it might be possible to revive interest, to make a new start.
He had felt that it contained some vague potentiality of that sort,
and when the offer came from the <i>San Francisco Herald</i> to be its
Tokyo correspondent, he had felt certain that the opportunity had come
for them, that she would appreciate it as well as he. For that reason
he had said nothing to her about it until every arrangement had been
made, the contract signed, that he might carry the glad tidings to her,
complete, that the realization of all that this meant to them might
sweep her off her feet and envelop her, as it had him. And then the
shock of her absolute coldness, when he had brought his surprise to
her; her absolute refusal to go to Japan. It had thrown him off his
feet, confused him, so that when she reproached him with secrecy, with
having taken this important step without even consulting her, trying to
learn her wishes, he had been able to explain only confusedly how with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the very best intentions he had meant to give her a splendid surprise;
how, in fact, he had had to restrain himself from telling her when the
first inkling of the great news came, just in order that he might make
the marvel of the revelation more complete. As he had tried to justify
himself, to explain, to convince her, her indifference had baffled
him&mdash;surely, commonplace and torpid as their relations had become, he
had never felt towards her the indifference which she apparently felt
towards him. And this had been followed by her absolute refusal to go
with him, accompanied by her statement that she did not object to his
going, that, in fact, she could understand that he must not lose the
great opportunity, that it really might be for the best for both of
them to live apart for some time, for some years&mdash;she had veiled her
speech in obscure indefiniteness, giving him, suddenly, the impression
that she expected that they would never come together again.</p>

<p>It had been borne in on him that in her heart she welcomed this as an
opportunity to end, through propitious circumstance, a relationship
which had become apathetic, a marriage which had failed. He could
understand her feeling&mdash;the thought was not unfamiliar to him&mdash;but
she had evidently progressed much farther than had he on the road of
indifference. Further conversations had brought the same result. She
had resolutely refused to place credence in his belief that life in a
new country might revive affection. She was not romantic, she had said,
and it was plain that separation would cause neither of them to suffer.
He had felt that had she given him but a little encouragement, the
slightest sympathy, he might ardently have swept her over to his belief
that here lay a chance for renewal of the affection of the first years;
but her indifference had chilled him. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>So they had parted, phlegmatically. Now he felt certain that this
episode had come to an end. He had tried marriage, and it had been a
failure. And such a stupid failure. There had been no other woman, and,
he felt sure, no other man. It had failed simply through inanition.
Still, it might have been worse. At least, there was no heartbreak,
no anguish. He had tried the marriage experiment. Probably he would
never have been content until he had tried it. Now, he had found that
it did not work; yet he was not much the worse. He enjoyed the company
of women only in the manner of a mild stimulant. Thus he would live
henceforth. He would have his new work to occupy him, and curiosity to
lift the curtain veiling the mystery of marriage would not affect him.
Like men who regard lack of desire for liquor as an asset, thus he felt
that his freedom from relation to, from craving for woman would be an
advantage. It would make for a peaceful and well-ordered life.</p>

<p>His thoughts lost themselves in indefiniteness, a pleasant Nirvana
of emptiness which resented the sound of footsteps approaching along
the deck behind him. He turned, annoyed. Still, it was not so bad. He
would rather have it be Lüttich than any of the others. The Russian had
a fortunate faculty of sympathetic adjustment, of ever being able to
attune himself to one's mood of the moment, serious, gay, reflective.
And he admired his talents, the facility with which he spoke French,
German, English, even Japanese, his easy mastery of the violin, and,
above all, his unobtrusive friendliness. He felt for him, also,
sympathy for his misfortunes and admiration for the careless manner
in which he had adapted himself to new circumstances. Hardships as an
officer during the war, imprisonment, escape through Siberia, and,
finally, adjustment to a fairly precarious existence as a teacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of languages and the violin to Japanese, had caused no bitterness.
"You never know what it is to be free from care until you have lost
everything," he had explained to Hugh. "<i>Nichivo!</i>"</p>

<p>Lüttich pointed out into the night before them. "To-morrow, Japan. What
will it bring?"</p>

<p>Hugh smiled. "Something like that. One dreams, reflects, speculates at
the future."</p>

<p>The Russian snapped his fingers. "Unprofitable. If the dreams are
pleasant, disappointment and disillusionment follow. If they are
unpleasant, why, they are not worth having. The true philosophy lies
in gathering the fullest measure of the pleasures of the moment. This
is the last night on board, remember. They are short of men, as usual.
Come on. Join the dance, and have a drink with me, <i>auf wiedersehen</i> in
Japan."</p>

<p>They walked aft together, where the ship's orchestra played to the
couples dancing in the obscure half-light of the moon and the Japanese
lanterns strung crisscross in wavy lines. Along the wall of the
deckhouse tables and chairs had been set close together so as to give
room for the dancers. They sat down and had their drink. Hugh was
still half immersed in reverie, but the Russian was active, febrile.
Presently he joined the dancers. Hugh watched the scene languidly.
He could always find enjoyment, food for idle speculation in the
odd assortment of passengers, international, Americans and Japanese
predominating; some falling into easily defined classes, missionaries,
business men, tourists; others more definitely characteristic,
individualistic; some particularly interesting in their baffling of
curiosity, about whom ship's gossip had contrived fanciful fables.</p>

<p>At the table next to him sat Baron Saiki, returning after years of
service at the Japanese Embassy at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> Washington, man of the world,
polyglot, marvelously well informed in international politics, a
striking contrast to his wife, who spoke little and who appeared
to have retained, in spite of years of residence abroad, the
self-effacement of Japanese women. Another contrast, again, was young
Miss Suzuki, who sat with them, college educated in America, stylish,
with even a French-like chic, in her fashionable gown and cleverly
arranged hair. Farther over was Miss Wilson, an American stenographer
returning to Yokohama, after a vacation in California, with Miss
Elliott, who had lived long in Japan where she was beginning to make a
success with her painting, water colors following largely the manner of
the Japanese color prints, but combining therewith a hint of Maxfield
Parrish, with intense blues and deft arrangement of light and shadow
contrast, which she cleverly contrived to work out into a style quite
peculiarly her own. She was one of the passengers whom Hugh hoped he
would meet again in his life in Japan.</p>

<p>Still farther over was a group of tourists, guidebooks on the table
before them, arranging the itinerary for a breathless chase through the
most conspicuous marvels of Japan. Then a table with a couple of girls
with bobbed hair, and a youth on his way to Shanghai. Farther over were
others whose faces were half effaced in the shadows. The approach to
land caused general animation. The dancers swung and gyrated to the
rhythm of jazz. Good-bys were said and promises to meet in Japan made
as drinks more numerous than usual marked the last night at sea.</p>

<p>"Are you glad to come back to Japan?"</p>

<p>It was Miss Suzuki who had turned to him. She spoke in Japanese. He
had often practiced speaking the language with her, rejoicing at the
facility with which he was regaining the once familiar tongue. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, though to me it will be like a new country," he answered.
"But I know that you must certainly be happy to return."</p>

<p>He was surprised to see the wistful expression which came over her
face. "I don't know." She spoke in English. He had noticed that she
found greater facility therein than in Japanese. "I don't know. I was
only eight when I left Japan. I am afraid I have become too foreign in
my ways and my mind, and my parents are such old-fashioned Japanese. It
may be very difficult; I am really quite afraid."</p>

<p>The orchestra crashed into a new dance. From the dimness beyond the
lanterns the ship's Adonis strode into the light, a young fellow on his
way to Tokyo as a student interpreter. He walked towards Miss Wilson.
Hugh saw her straighten expectantly, eyes meeting the boy. But Adonis'
roving eye had perceived Miss Kanae, a Japanese girl who with her
parents had joined the ship at Honolulu. He changed direction, bowed,
smiled, and the two glided in among the dancing couples.</p>

<p>Miss Wilson flushed angrily. Her glance swept away, encountered his for
a moment, took in his companion with obvious disapproval.</p>

<p>"I don't see how a white man can bring himself to dance with one of
these."</p>

<p>It was said loudly enough to carry across the tables. Evidently
intentionally, with a desire to wound. Hugh saw the Baron wince almost
imperceptibly. He knew that the girl at his side must have heard. The
orchestra fiddled on to a crashing finish. The dancers called for an
encore. The violins struck up again. Hugh turned to her.</p>

<p>"I wish you would let me have this dance, Miss Suzuki?"</p>

<p>He saw her flush. "I think I would rather not. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> did not think you
danced. I have not seen you dance at all."</p>

<p>"I have not." He did not care greatly for dancing. "But this is the
last night, you know. Surely you will not deny me this one dance at
parting."</p>

<p>She hesitated. He bowed ceremoniously. She arose slowly, and he led her
out among the dancers. He was pleased to find how lightly she danced,
elfin-like fine and graceful movements following his. The glare of
Miss Wilson's eyes directly into his as they passed her gave him grim
satisfaction. He knew that she knew what was in his mind. She would be
implacable. How easy it was to make enemies in this world. He danced
mechanically. The thought spoiled his enjoyment. Then his mind reverted
to his partner. She was smiling up to him. What a shame it was to wound
wantonly such a dainty child, for, after all, that was all she was.</p>

<p>"We shall dance often like this, in Japan, shall we not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Her smile became a little dubious. "I hope so. We shall
see."</p>

<p>He made up his mind that he must try to come into touch with her in
Tokyo. The music ceased. He led her back to her seat. The Baron smiled.
"You will have a drink with me before we go below, Mr. Kent. It is
getting late, but we shall have our nightcap." They drank slowly. "I
hope to see you in Tokyo," said the Baron. "Your business will take you
to the Foreign Office very often, I know. I expect to be in Japan for a
while. Look me up there. I may be of some use to you. Good night."</p>

<p>After all, how easy it was to make friends, also.</p>

<p>They arose. The Baroness bowed to him silently. The girl gave him her
hand. "Good night. <i>Arigato de gozaimazu.</i>" She smiled to him and
followed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> others before he could collect himself to reply. She was
a charming child. He hoped that he would come to know her better, in
Japan.</p>

<p>The Russian came up to him. "Good boy." He patted him on the shoulder.
So others had noticed. He looked over for the Wilson girl, but she had
disappeared. Miss Elliott caught his glance, beckoned him over.</p>

<p>"You throw yourself into the battle quickly, even before you have
reached Japan," she smiled. "You have chosen your side early. It may
not be entirely wise, but I liked it. Thank you."</p>

<p>It embarrassed him. "But surely it was the only thing to do, you know.
She heard it. It was so unexpected, so utterly undeserved."</p>

<p>"I know. Still, you will see much of just that kind of thing in Japan.
I feel sorry for that poor girl. She will have a hard time, and she
suspects it. You know, she went to America when she was only eight
years old, was adopted by her uncle and aunt. They sent her to college.
She has been thoroughly foreignized. Now they have both died and she
is going back to her own family. I know of them. Her brothers have
both been abroad and have the foreign manner, but they are Japanese.
She is nothing, neither Japanese nor foreign, or, rather, she is
both, Japanese body and foreign mind. And her parents are typically
old-fashioned Japanese. She has learned to expect the courtesy, the
deference paid our women, the 'ladies first' of our world. Now she
will be forced into the strait-jacket of Japanese women. She will be
beautifully dressed and will have motor cars and all that, but she will
learn that her freedom is gone, her personality is gone, and that it
is 'men first' always in Japan. That is the way it will be with her
with the Japanese, and then, if she goes with the foreigners, if she
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> allowed to mingle with them well&mdash;you saw what happened to-night.
It is fortunate for her that she will not live in Yokohama. In Tokyo
it is better. There the foreigners are scattered, and they mingle more
sympathetically, generally, with the Japanese; but in Yokohama, where
all the foreigners live together in the Settlement, with their little
cliques, and coteries, and constant gossip and observing what every one
does, there a girl like she is much held at arm's length. It is the
women mainly who cause it. They make the men feel that they must not
show too much interest, or they suffer their displeasure."</p>

<p>"But a girl like that; why she's a mere child!"</p>

<p>"A mere child." She laughed. "I have so often wondered, when the men
always say that about these girls, whether they really are so dense.
Is it possible that the mere smallness and quaintness really blind
them. Can't they see that they are as much women as we are, with the
same thoughts, with passions as intense as those of all other women. Of
course, many of the men must know better, must have learned&mdash;&mdash;" She
seemed to seek for words, gave it up, laughed. "You know, I am becoming
involved in a delicate subject. After all, you must see for yourself
and form your own conclusions."</p>

<p>The Russian was coming towards them. She rose. "It is late, and we must
be up early if we are to see Fuji. If you want more information, ask
Mr. Lüttich. Men can explain such things better. Good night."</p>

<p>"Lüttich," Kent turned to the Russian. "Miss Elliott was just hinting
that the lot of the foreign-educated Japanese girl in Japan is not a
very happy one. What do you know about it? It interests me."</p>

<p>Lüttich shrugged his shoulders. "One of the pangs of the transition
that Japan is going through. It is the whole keynote to Japan
to-day. The nation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> trying to squeeze a feudal chain and mail
outfit in under the white shirt front of modernity, and the process
causes difficulties. The point is that, with all her modern veneer,
railroads, electric lights, factories, street cars and all that, Japan
is still feudal entirely in thought. Take your friend, Baron Saiki,
for instance; as polished a diplomat as you can find in Washington or
London. To-morrow, back in Japan, his mind will be as feudal as was
that of his ancestors three hundred years ago. In fact, it has always
remained so, but the Japanese have learned to put on a foreign suit of
thought, just as they put on a foreign suit of clothes, and, under it
all, the old feudal thought remains unchanged, just like their skins.</p>

<p>"In that way you see these well-bred men and women of Japan attending
social functions, dressed like us, acting like us, following our codes
and manners, and that is about all you see of their lives, the modern,
the outward part. But the everyday life, that which goes on behind
the walls and <i>shoji</i>, which you seldom get even a glimpse of, that
has not changed. There the old feudal era is persisting. The wife is
subservient to her husband, the daughters must obey and serve their
brothers. And after all, it works well; in fact, apparently better
than our system. They have practically no marital scandals. The Empire
is built on the foundation of the family and it seems to wear well;
it would be foolish to tamper with it, to try to replace it with
something, our system, for instance, which is hardly a success. And it
is my firm belief that generally the Japanese women are happy, every
bit as happy as those of America or Europe. That system is what they
have always known. It may be the bliss which is born of ignorance, but
as long as the ignorance remains they are happy.</p>

<p>"Now that is where the point comes in about girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> like Miss Suzuki.
She has become accustomed to our ways, our point of view. She expects
to take the usual precedence, to receive the usual courtesies from
men, to be waited on by them. And now, in her home, the men will walk
in advance and she will follow. If she drops something she will pick
it up herself, but if her brothers drop it, she will have to scramble
after it, and if a servant is not handy, they will order her about like
one. Now, if she had never seen anything else all her life, that would
be natural; she would never give it a thought. But she has grown up
under our conventions. She cannot help but long for the courtesy, the
deference, which she has become used to, which she craves for. But,
first of all, she does not go out much, as do our girls, for Japanese
women don't attend, generally, social functions where both sexes are
present, except garden parties, receptions and other boresome affairs.
But even if she does go out, say to teas, hotel dances and such things,
and even if she receives there from the modernized young Japanese the
outward show of courtesy which is part of modern social usage, she
knows that it is all for the moment only. Her brother who picks up her
fan at the Imperial Hotel will send her scurrying for his slippers at
home. If she marries the young blood who obsequiously leads her to
her seat in the ballroom, she will jolly well walk behind him if she
marries him.</p>

<p>"That, I think, is the tragedy of the modernized Japanese girl, that
she has had a glimpse of ideals which she will probably never attain.
Of course, there may be some heart-burning at the attitude of some of
the foreign lady cats, who would prevent white men from associating
with the Japanese girls. It is natural that they resent the charm which
these girls have for many of the young men who should be the exclusive
property of the women of their own race; but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> obtains mainly in
Yokohama, and very little in Tokyo, where the foreigners are scattered
and where the biggest guns in the social world are undeniably Japanese.
And outside of some isolated incidents like that to-night, I don't
think that point counts much. The fact is that while the Japanese
girl who has had some contact with foreigners undoubtedly wishes that
our manner of treating our women might be extended to them, you will
find that marriages of ladies of the aristocracy with foreigners are
extremely rare. The man who thinks he is regarded as a prize simply
because he is white is a fool. Among the lower and middle classes
it is probably different. To many of these girls the courtesy and
consideration shown by foreign men to their women must contrast sharply
with the prospect of a life of constant obedience, subservience and
drudgery, first to her brothers and then to her husband. They say that
once a Japanese girl has had relations with a foreigner, at least a
decent foreigner, she almost never wishes to take up with men of her
own people. I've seen a lot of cases which make me believe that this
is true. But girls of the class of Miss Suzuki are practically never
allowed to marry foreigners, and foreigners of their class hardly ever
marry Japanese. So they must be unhappy, poor dears. They despise the
trammels of Japanese married life, and that which they have learned
to wish for they can't attain. The lives of these girls, the pioneers
of their sex in attainment of western culture, is one of the many
tragedies of Japan in transition."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>They arrived too late in the morning to see Fuji-san. Clouds lay over
the mountain ranges and smoky haze obscured the land, only the nearest
foreshore appearing, gray, formless, without detail. It might have been
the California coast, any coast line, in fact. Only the sampans which
passed them, standing out to sea, with their characteristic square
sails, high galleon-like poops, indicated the Orient. They passed
quarantine. A launch came up smartly to the ship's ladder. A tall man
in pongee waved his big white sun-helmet up to Kent.</p>

<p>It was Erik Karsten. Kent had expected to see him. They had been
friends, when Karsten was dramatic and art critic on the <i>Herald</i>,
before he had gone to Japan some years ago. They had corresponded and
Kent had looked after his son, young Mortimer Karsten, until the boy
had graduated from the university and had gone to Europe for further
study. Karsten had written him, when he had heard that he was coming to
Japan, that he must make his home with him, at least until he decided
to make other arrangements. It made it particularly pleasant. They were
warm friends.</p>

<p>They climbed up the ladder, police officials, steamship agents, Karsten
and the rest. The friends shook hands.</p>

<p>"By Cæsar, but it is good to see you," said Karsten. "I have been
feeling a bit lonesome these last few years. I am glad you will stay
with me, at least for a while. Here, give your trunk keys to Martin.
He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> will see your stuff through the customs. It will be too late to get
to Tokyo for tiffin, so we will eat at the Grand. Then you can take a
turn about Yokohama, and we'll be in Tokyo in time for dinner."</p>

<p>He went through the usual form of police examination. The steamer
crept up to the wharf. Yokohama was as he had expected, the foreign
settlement drab and tedious as of old; the typically Japanese section
had receded a bit farther into the background; there were a few more
red-brick official buildings. The return brought no thrill. Even the
rickshaw seemed commonplace after he had ridden in it a few minutes.
He felt as if he had been away from Japan only a score of weeks rather
than a score of years.</p>

<p>Though he had halfway expected this, he was disappointed. Karsten read
his thought.</p>

<p>"Yokohama always disappoints, doesn't it? I shall never forget my shock
when I first came to the Fabled Orient and found this nondescript
changeling of a city. Tokyo is becoming spoiled, too. They are covering
it with electric poles, tangles of wires, atrocious buildings, all
the dreariness of civilization, which they have a positive genius for
making as obtrusive as possible. It seems almost that when they copy
our civilization they make a point of making the worst parts thereof
the most conspicuous. They can endow them with a hideousness which you
don't find in any other place in the world. Still, Tokyo is not as bad
as Yokohama. You may still find large quarters which are Japan. I have
found such a place. I hope you will like it."</p>

<p>They arrived at Karsten's house late in the afternoon. Hugh felt
his hopes rise as they left the prosy, noisy main streets and their
rickshaws began a tortuous journey through narrow alleys, through a
typically Japanese quarter, with clean wooden houses, latticed paper
windows, grilled entrances, bamboo fences, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> daintily contrived
roofed gates through which might be glimpsed miniature gardens, with
dwarfed pines, stone lanterns, curved paths of broad gray stones.</p>

<p>A steep stone stairway, winding erratically up the hillside against
which nestled the quarter below, brought them to Karsten's house. Thank
God, here was a place such as he would wish to live in, which was in
harmony with his dreams of the spirit of Japan. Japanese in every
detail, set in a cool garden overlooking the cluster of houses through
which they had passed. In the rear lay a great temple, set in extensive
grounds, a cool, calm space shadowed by old trees conveying a feeling
of vast, eternal peace.</p>

<p>"You see, I am almost literally between the devil and the deep sea."
Karsten swept his hand before him. "These houses below are a geisha
quarter, as you might know by the immaculate trimness and careful
detail. It is more characteristic at night, when the lights are
lit. You'll see. There, behind us, in the temple grounds, you may
always find peace, rest. Can it be a sort of telepathic influence? I
don't know; but it seems almost as if centuries of calm meditation,
projection of their minds into the infinite by generations of priests,
the devout prayers of hundreds of thousands of worshipers, from cradle
to grave, have permeated the whole space with an atmosphere, an aura
of infinite peace. I am absolutely pagan. I have no creed or religious
philosophy whatever. Still, sitting alone in this place, letting my
thoughts go, I come nearer the idea that there is something, some one,
some force, above, beyond, eternal, dominant, controlling the universe.
Buddha, God, call it by whatever name you like, but some vast, hidden,
mysterious force. Anyway, if I am troubled, agitated, here I may always
find peace."</p>

<p>They entered the house. A tall, handsome Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> woman met them,
bowed deeply, gracefully. "<i>O hairi nasai.</i> Please enter."</p>

<p>The soft, deep ring of her voice, its musical modulation; the richness
of her silks in spite of their somber shades; the every evidence that
here was a woman of refinement, a gentlewoman, startled Kent. Plainly
this was no servant. Could it be that Karsten had contracted one of
these indefinite Loti'esque temporary arrangements which are fairly
common in Japan? Still, then he would have said something about it. He
wondered.</p>

<p>But Karsten gave no explanation.</p>

<p>"Jun-san, this is Kent-san. Kent, Jun-san has been looking forward to
your coming. She is pleased that you speak Japanese. She speaks no
English."</p>

<p>She clapped her hands. A servant came, took their hats. They entered a
large, cool room, upstairs, whence they had a full view of the clusters
of geisha houses below. Jun-san followed, brought tea. He noticed that
she drank also. Evidently not a servant; probably an "<i>oku-san</i>," after
all? Still, in such case it was odd that Karsten had not mentioned
it. Well, time would tell soon enough. He liked her presence there,
sitting gracefully, Japanese-fashion, on a silk cushion, ever watchful,
attentive to anticipate their wants. Her mere being there lent an air
of rich, but delicate, exotic Oriental beauty to the room, as though
she were some infinitely wonderful, gorgeous ornament, contrived to
harmonize with, to add grace to the surroundings. He liked the soft,
slow smile when she answered him in her grave contralto voice; but
he noticed that when she was not speaking, when he and Karsten were
conversing in English, when she took no part, she was ever watching
Karsten, with an expression of sadness, it seemed to him, a hint of
wistfulness. It oppressed him a little with its indefinite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> mystery. He
tried to put the thought away, as he went on talking with Karsten, but
he could not free himself from the sense of an oppression of sadness,
vaguely permeating the house as might a breath of heavy incense. He
felt himself seized, unaccountably, knowing no definite reason, with a
feeling of compassion, of sympathy, for Jun-san.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>Kent's office was in the rear of a building in the Shimbashi section, a
corner room facing two sides on narrow alleys, neither more than four
feet wide. His landlord, Nishimura, whose International Agency occupied
the front, was holding forth volubly. He would talk inexhaustibly about
his life, his affairs and, principally, about his manifold abilities,
in English, for he had lived for years in the United States.</p>

<p>As he talked, Kittrick came in. Kent had known him years ago, in the
San Francisco Press Club, before he had gone to Japan for the Universal
Syndicate. He hoped that his arrival would put an end to Nishimura's
talk, but the Japanese only waved a greeting to Kittrick&mdash;evidently he
knew him. He bubbled on.</p>

<p>"I am very pleased that I can always help you, in anything, everything.
If you want anything, ask Nishimura. I can get you access to all the
big men, the ministers of state, the politicians, the big business men,
everybody. I can get you anything, an interview, a clerk, invitations
to the official functions, a streetcar pass, a sweetheart," he leered
suggestively. "You have a unique advantage of situation, Mr. Kent,
between knowledge," he pointed towards the region of the International
Agency, "and pleasure," he waved his hand generally in the direction
of the walls and paper-covered <i>shoji</i> appearing, familiarly close,
through the office windows.</p>

<p>"It is a select neighborhood, Mr. Kent. The heart of the most refined
geisha quarter, hidden, so discreetly, don't you think, behind our
respectability, yours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> and mine. There, you see, is the Akebono
<i>machiai</i>, one of the most famous waiting houses, where you may feast
with geisha." He pointed across one of the alleys where the <i>shojis</i>
had been drawn aside, the wide window opening displaying a large,
immaculately clean room, furnished with the constraint usual in Japan,
with only a low table and some silk cushions, a <i>kakemono</i>, hanging
silk scroll picture, in the <i>tokonoma</i> recess. "A very quiet place
usually in the day," he explained. "But at night, ah, what scenes of
revelry, with happy guests disporting themselves with sake wine and
the pretty geisha." He sighed and threw wide his arms, as would he,
ravished, press to his breast one of the beauties of his imagination.
"You shall see, Mr. Kent, even here," now he was pointing through
the window in the other wall to a smaller house. The closed, opaque
paper <i>shoji</i>, bamboo barred, were almost within arm's length. From
beyond it came the strident whimper of samisen strings. "That is
O-Toshi-san," he explained confidentially, impressively, "the famous
O-Toshi-san. You shall see her often, there in her window; but, Mr.
Kent, do not lose your heart there. No, don't," he became even more
confidential, suggestively smiling. "She belongs to Mr. Kato, the
police commissioner. He paid big <i>makura-kin</i>, pillow-money, oh, so
big, I hear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A clerk entered and whispered to Nishimura. "I am so sorry," said the
landlord. "My affairs. I must go, but I shall come and see you often.
Good morning."</p>

<p>It was a relief. His chatter had filled the room, monopolized the
situation. "I have certainly fallen into a queer neighborhood," said
Kent. "I shall apparently have a liberal and inexpensive education in
geisha matters. What did he mean by pillow-money, anyway?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's so; you left Japan too young to know about such things," said
Kittrick. "Well, the institution differs considerably, according to
locality, I think, but it means ordinarily a sum paid to a geisha who
then becomes, so far as love favors are concerned, the exclusive jewel
of the man who pays it. She may, of course, continue to entertain
other guests as a singer or dancer and so forth, but that man is, or
is supposed to be, her only lover. In fact, you know, you are not
as queerly situated as you think you are. The geisha quarters are
scattered in various parts of the city; you find them rubbing up
against business and office quarters in lots of places. They are not
bad neighbors at all. You may come to like these girls. For while
some of them are just common women, many are quite exclusive, as, for
instance, your neighbor lady appears to be, with just one lover; and
not a few are absolutely clean morally, virginal, even though they
make their living by singing, and playing, and entertaining men in
their idle hours. For the Japanese they are institutional. In many
cases important business deals are closed only in the <i>machiai</i>, with
geisha adding grace to the occasion. Statesmen discuss their affairs
in their presence. The Japanese tired business man, when he wants a
change from the formality of family life, finds relaxation in a few
hours with them, drinking, chatting, listening to their singing,
enjoying their bright wit; often, as a rule, I think, that is all,
though, of course, it frequently goes further. I myself have come to
appreciate very much the Japanese point of view. There is so little to
do in Tokyo, no theaters or concerts to speak of; only the cinemas.
So occasionally, when time hangs on my hands, I go to some clean
little tea house, call a geisha or two, lie about comfortably, lazily,
enjoy their chatter&mdash;they are such merry, charming children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> You get
complete relaxation. It is easy to understand how the Japanese men,
whose wives, as gentlewomen, could not and would not think of unbending
to the gay fripperies of such talk and play, find their amusement with
these girls. Of course, many of the men have sweethearts, mistresses,
<i>mekakes</i>, concubines, as they commonly are called, but these things
are not as greatly different from similar phenomena in America and
Europe as you might think, and I am under the impression that the
characteristically Japanese concubine system, if there is such a thing,
is gradually dying out.</p>

<p>"However, I didn't come here to talk geisha. If you want me to show you
the ropes as a newspaperman, I'm going now to the Foreign Office, and
you had better come along."</p>

<p>The first glimpse of the Foreign Office attracted Kent&mdash;the great
wall, with white mortar forming big lozenges, the only glimpse of
typical Japan in the vicinity where great red brick buildings, the Navy
Department, the courts, and, gray and forbidding, imposing even while
its walls were crumbling, the Russian Embassy, formed the nucleus of
official Japan. But once inside the iron grilled gate, the Foreign
Office buildings were unimpressive, tediously modern. They did not
even go to the main structure, but went to the right into a long, drab
edifice.</p>

<p>"This will be one of your main points in your work," said Kittrick, as
they waited while the solemn old commissionaire shuffled upstairs to
announce them. "This is the information bureau of the Foreign Office,
the main function of which is to see that foreign correspondents are
kept satisfied with as little information as possible. We are now about
to see the head oracle, Mr. Kubota. He was in London and Washington for
years, and Japanese officialdom speaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> highly of his abilities. He has
to be quite a diplomat, you know, to answer a great many questions and
still give out next to no information, anyway."</p>

<p>The commissionaire appeared and ushered them into Kubota's office,
a large, simply furnished room. A middle-aged, pleasant-faced man,
immaculate in frock coat, rose to greet them. His English was perfect.
He was courteously cordial. One liked him instinctively. They chatted
awhile about Kent's plans, how he liked Japan, the usual trivialities.
"I hope you will come here often. We shall all be glad to be of every
service possible to you, I and my assistants."</p>

<p>He called over a young man who had been sitting in the background. "My
chief assistant, Mr. Kikuchi," he introduced. Kikuchi, more interesting
at first sight than his chief, was a typical young aristocrat, in rich
silk kimono, with long, sensitive fingers, urbanely smiling. Kent
learned later on that he was regarded as one of the rising men in the
Foreign Office, a man with brains as well as prestige. His father,
Viscount Kikuchi, was considered, in the most intimately informed
circles, to be the leading mind of the Privy Council.</p>

<p>"We have heard of you already from Baron Saiki," said Kikuchi, shaking
Kent's hand firmly. "We shall be glad to become your good friends, if
we may. In fact&mdash;&mdash;" he glanced towards his chief.</p>

<p>The older man smiled. "Yes, Mr. Kittrick, we had, in fact, thought
of having one of our little tea parties as a welcome to Mr. Kent and
for Mr. Jones, you know, who came a few weeks ago for the <i>New York
Chronicle</i>. To get them acquainted, just a few of us from the office
here and the newspapermen. We have these little informal, friendly
gatherings now and then, Mr. Kent. Do you think you should like to
come?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Kent thanked him. They chatted for a while. Kent was introduced to a
few more officials, all pleasant, extremely urbane, fluent in English.
Then they came away.</p>

<p>"It should be pleasant to come here," commented Kent. "They seem
intelligent and friendly. I like them."</p>

<p>"They are pleasant," replied Kittrick. "And clever too, though, queerly
enough, it is the common thing for the Japanese to regard the Foreign
Office as a pretty stupid institution. Although it has done mighty
well, it seems to me, disentangling the foreign policy mess left by
Terauchi and his ilk, cleaning up the Yap, Shantung, Chinese and
Siberian questions, the Japanese people and press seem to think that
they are a pretty poor lot. Of course, they have had a fairly hard time
of it with the War Office, the General Staff. Many people think that
they are unduly under the thumb of the militarists, but the very fact
that the army and navy Ministers are not responsible to the Cabinet
makes running the foreign policy harder, as the militarists have had
the habit of letting the Foreign Office propose, and then doing the
disposing themselves, and that seems to me to make what our diplomatic
friends have done the more praiseworthy.</p>

<p>"Yes, you will find the Foreign Office crowd pleasant," he continued.
"But as a source of information you'll find them disappointing. Like
all the rest of the officials, they are obsessed with the national
mania for secrecy. All the officials seem to think that they may get
into all kinds of trouble by telling the press something; that they
can never get into trouble when they tell nothing. The great cry of
the Japanese is constantly that they are misunderstood by the rest
of the world, and still when we fellows who honestly want to bring
about understanding try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> to help them along, they won't help us or
themselves. Say, for instance, that some fool report against Japan
crops up in Washington, or London, or Paris, and you come here to get
the thing straightened out, to get Japan's side; you will, as a rule,
find it is like pulling teeth, and often, when you do get the story,
they won't let you quote the Foreign Minister, or even the Foreign
Office generally. They want you to cable that 'it is reported,' or 'it
is said' or 'there are indications that,' taking all the value out
of the statement. Then, if you want to see one of the Ministers or
some other big gun, they will probably arrange that you see him&mdash;they
are tremendously obliging, I admit&mdash;but it will take a week or more
before the interview can be arranged, and in the meantime the harm
has been done abroad. Your story, Japan's version, has become old as
Genesis, it has gone cold. And then they sit up and wail that the
world misunderstands them. All this talk you hear about the infernally
clever, insidious Japanese propaganda is plain rot. If there is one
thing they don't know a thing about, it is propaganda. They have their
propaganda newspapers, it is true, particularly in China, but everybody
knows them, and they don't count. This talk about the Foreign Office
handing out huge sums to writers and others is funny. The War Office
people have the funds, and I daresay they spend them where they think
it will do good. The General Staff, that is the secret force in the
Japanese Government, and you and I never hear what goes on in there.
See its headquarters, that old, gray building with the green copper
roof; that's the last remaining stronghold of militarism, in its good
old form, on this earth; and General Matsu, the chief, is the proper
high priest, the simon-pure militarist, with ethics as primitive
as those of a cave man. They are giving in now. They have to, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Japanese public opinion about spending great sums on armies is the same
as it is in the rest of the world, but they are clever. They feel&mdash;it
is probably their sincere idea of patriotism&mdash;that Japan can be great
only by militarism, and where they reduce the army by two soldiers,
they probably buy one machine gun, making up in strength in one way
what they lose in the other. They probably feel that if they can't
preserve Japan's strength openly on account of public opinion, they
must do it quietly, for Japan's good. But there, under that green roof,
lie the forces of old Japan, and there, on the other side of the city,
in the students' quarter in Kanda, in the laborers' quarters of Honjo
and Fukagawa, the forces of new thought are stirring and fermenting.
It is medieval feudalism as opposed to modern industrialism, with a
lot of more 'isms thrown in, Socialism, Communism, Sovietism even, new
ideas, half understood, misunderstood, but grasped at with passionate
eagerness, the young generation and the workers seeking such morsels
of new thought, often the worse thought, that they can find, and
swallowing them, half digested, or not digested at all.</p>

<p>"There is danger in all this. There is a turbulence of too precipitate
transition. It needs wise handling. There is good in it all, this
passionate desire for making Japan modern, but all these young,
restless forces should be directed, led along wholesome paths, and
all that the powers-that-be&mdash;the militarists, the capitalists, the
police&mdash;seem to know is repression. I can see lots of good in both
sides, the cautious conservatism of the old generation which clings
desperately to the ancient virtues which it sees spurned; and which
sees all that is bad, unwholesome, in the new movement; and the young
generation which wants to create a new Japan in a day, which wants to
walk before it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> has learned to crawl, which is prone to discard the
virtues and values of old Japan before it has learned to understand and
use modern, Western civilization. It is a game for high stakes which is
going on here under our eyes, where immeasurably precious values of an
old civilization, unique, irreplaceable, are likely to be lost, to be
thrown ruthlessly aside; and, on the other hand, there is loss every
day that the intentness, the eagerness of the younger generation, of
the masses in the cities where they have acquired zest for modernism,
is suffered to waste itself in futile groping after lots of unwholesome
stuff, which they think must be good fruit mainly because it is
forbidden; especially when all this eagerness to learn, this ambitious
energy might, with a little sympathy, a bit of understanding wisdom, be
made into a tremendous power for constructive good. The longer you live
here, Kent, the more you will come to see that what Japan needs to-day,
what she must have, is another Meiji, some strong, wise directing
force, a truly big man&mdash;but there is no such man to-day."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>A row of shoes in the entrance of the tea house told them that most of
the others had already arrived. A flock of maidservants met them, took
their hats and canes, waiting while Kent and Kittrick took off their
shoes. Kikuchi appeared. "We are nearly all of us here," he smiled.
"Come in. Make yourself at home, Mr. Kent, Kittrick-san will tell you
that we don't stand on ceremony."</p>

<p>In a large room, unfurnished save for a few <i>kakemono</i> pictures, they
found Kubota and half a dozen Foreign Office men, with six or seven
correspondents, talking, smoking. Butterfield of the <i>Times</i> and
Templeton of the <i>Express</i> were old hands, with many years in Japan
behind them. Most of the others were far more recent arrivals. Some of
them showed by the self-conscious lack of ease of the white man when
he first finds himself, socially, in stocking feet, that they were
still new in Japan. Kent was introduced. The conversation flowed on, in
groups. Tea and cigarettes were served.</p>

<p>A maid slid aside some of the partitions and they looked into a large
room with small, individual lacquered tables set in three sides of a
square, each with a cushion on the matting. "Please take your seats,
gentlemen," Kubota waved them in. "Take your places where you please."</p>

<p>They squatted on the cushions. Kent was pleased to have on one side
young Kikuchi. He had taken an instinctive liking to him. On the other
side was Jones, a dumpy, solemn-faced man, fidgety, ill at ease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Beyond him was Kittrick. Farther along, on both sides, sat the rest,
Japanese and foreigners mingled. Conversation flowed easily, mostly in
English.</p>

<p>Soup was brought in lacquered, covered bowls, and a cloud of geisha
appeared, a score or more, brightly clad in shimmering silks, with
huge brocade obi scarfs fashioned in elaborate bow-like arrangements.
The curious whitening of the faces, with the black, delicately arched
eyebrows, almond eyes, crimson lips, fantastically high headdress,
tastefully contrived contrasts of color, all served to provide an
exotic air, to produce the impression that, after all, this was Japan,
a unique country, different from all others. The deadening effect of
trite modernism produced by the modern garb of the Japanese hosts,
their perfect foreign polish, faded into the background. The geisha
scattered among the tables, seating themselves with the guests, smiling
to them, attending to their needs. As he looked across the table into
the pretty face opposite him, Kent experienced a sense of grateful
relief. Thank God, the bloom and charm of old fairy-tale-like Japan had
not all faded away yet.</p>

<p>He fumbled with his chopsticks. He had almost forgotten the art of
using them. The geisha gently took them from him, smiled engagingly,
showed him how to use them. "<i>So desho.</i>"</p>

<p>He thanked her in Japanese. Her finely formed hands, small like a
child's, came up in surprise. "But you can't use chopsticks; you are
new in Japan; and still you speak Japanese. <i>Bikuri shimashita.</i> I am
surprised."</p>

<p>The spirit of the thing swept over him. He felt as if he had played
with geisha all his life. "It is true. I have just come. But I looked
into your bright eyes, and see, the words have come to me. It is a
gift." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think you lie." She eyed him dubiously. Japanese girls are disposed
to take literally even the unbelievable. "Kikuchi-san, he lies, doesn't
he?"</p>

<p>But Kikuchi smilingly upheld him. "It is true. He has just come. You
know, these foreigners are truly wonderful people."</p>

<p>"It is wonderful." She clapped her hands delightedly, called over
other girls that they might share in the marvel. They twittered like
birds. Kent suddenly found himself the center of attention, enjoyed
the exhilaration of flashing <i>jeu de mots</i>, though he found that his
childhood's vocabulary served only haltingly in the bright thrust and
parry repartée with the geisha.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you could speak Japanese. What are they saying?" It
was the querulous voice of Jones. Kent felt a quick pang of sympathy
for him; he had been forgotten, neglected even by the geisha in the
excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh, I lived here as a child, and I remember a little, but I told
that girl that I was learning the language from her eyes; such is the
gay foolishness with geisha, irresponsibility, laughter, that is the
charm." But he could not draw Jones in. "I see," was his only reply,
and he turned to the food before him.</p>

<p>More food was brought, course after course, daintily served, strange
dishes, often puzzling as to how they must be eaten. The geisha
fluttered about, changing from table to table, staying a few minutes
with this guest, a bit longer with this other, charmingly gay,
beautiful creatures, woman bodies in butterfly raiment, and with the
radiant spontaneous happiness of children. And with all their laughing
familiarity, intimacy almost, they were constantly watchful, alert to
attend the men, with bewildering skill picking the bones from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> the
trout, which were served whole, leaf-garlanded, on richly ornamented
porcelain. Sake was brought in, hot, in small stone bottles. Guests
and geisha lifted steaming little cups, laughed, drank, the girls
constantly refilling the tiny bowls. The atmosphere titillated with
laughter and talk. The men stretched themselves more easily on their
cushions. Some rose and went visiting at other tables. The room was
electric with gayety, staccato Japanese and guttural English words
mingling, accompanied, set off by the rippling laughter of the geisha.</p>

<p>Kubota had begun the journey which is the function of the host. From
table to table he proceeded, offering a cup of sake to each guest. The
guests drank; each rinsed the cup in the bowl of water on the table
before him, the ones who were old in Japan doing it expertly, immersing
the bowl and withdrawing it suddenly so that the water was sucked in by
the vacuum with a gurgling cluck. Then the guest would hold the bowl
out towards the geisha. She filled it, and he handed it to Kubota, who
drank ceremoniously, said a few words of polite greeting, and passed on
to the next guest. He passed his cup to Kent. "I am glad to greet you
here as a new friend," he said. "I hope we may often enjoy ourselves
together." They drank.</p>

<p>Kubota passed on to Jones' table, held out his cup, but Jones waved it
away. "Thanks, but I disapprove of liquor." A look of blank surprise
crept over Kubota's face. The hand with the cup remained outstretched.
It took him a moment to adjust himself to the surprising situation.
Then he smiled engagingly. But Jones remained solemn, impassive.
Kittrick came to the rescue. "Are you not going to drink with me, Mr.
Kubota?" The incident passed, but Kent felt his sympathy for Jones
turning to disgust. He turned impatiently to the geisha. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was a stir among the girls. A number of them were running
towards the space where there were no tables. Samisens were brought in.
Three of the girls seated themselves, began tuning the instruments.
Three others ranged themselves in line and stood waiting. Suddenly
ivory plectra smote taut strings. In a loud treble, almost stridently,
the voices of the singers rose over the noisy clamor of the music.
The dancers postured for a moment, each with a fan, closed, held
straight before her. A chord was struck. Instantly the three fans
were snapped open, simultaneously, with a graceful, wide sweep of
arms, deep, fluttering sleeves following the undulating movements of
small, bejeweled hands. The guests leaned back, watching the brilliant
picture, the three girls, faces set in conventional expressionless
masks, rich, gorgeous silks waving and sweeping in rhythmic movement,
synchronizing with the bizarre cadences of the samisens and the voices,
a picture of graceful lines, swaying and changing harmoniously,
waves of radiant, flaming colors and shimmering, indefinite tints.
The real Orient finally, gorgeous, rare, exotic. A wave of pleasure,
satisfaction, swept over Kent. Impulsively he turned to Jones.</p>

<p>"Barbaric." The cold, hard tone cut in like a discord. Kent stared
at him. Great heavens, what a point of view! He was about to turn
impatiently towards the dancers, but Jones cut in quickly. It was as
if anger, resentment, disgust, had been accumulating in him, from one
phase of the entertainment to another, had been pent up, gathering
volume until he must free himself of his thoughts. He seemed to clamor
for Kent's attention, to demand it, speaking nervously, jerkily, finger
tips drumming on the table top in emphasis.</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't come. It is a shock to me to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> these men, high
officials of the Government, publicly, brazenly disporting themselves
with these women, common women, singers, dancers. And, I really can't
help saying it, to see white men, Americans, entering into this
degradation. Look at it," he swept his hand towards the dancers,
swaying in soft, seductive movement before his irritated eyes. A small
<i>hangyoku</i>, geisha apprentice, sitting close by, saw his outstretched
hand. She glanced at him, puzzled, eager to be of service, and hastily
handed him a cup of sake. He swept it aside, and she gazed at him,
wondering, black child's eyes large with surprise against the white
powder of her face, quaint doll features contrasting oddly against the
high coiffure.</p>

<p>Jones went on urgently, as if in competition with the whimper and cry
of the samisens, the strident voices. "It seems to me that we white
men should set them an example, that we have a duty to perform, that
even as we are newspapermen, we should assist the missionaries, act as
missionaries here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kittrick's attention had been attracted. He cut in. "If you will
pardon me, Mr. Jones, I think we have too many missionaries here
already. Japan has far less misery and crime than there is in our
big cities, New York, Chicago, San Francisco. Why don't they clean
up at home first, where they are needed, maybe, before they come out
here. You take my word for it, Mr. Jones, Japan can get along quite
nicely without them, and so can the rest of us. But what is the use of
talking. If you can't enjoy the hospitality you have accepted, at least
have the decency not to criticize it. Here, little beauty," he turned
to the <i>hangyoku</i>. "Fill the cups, please. Have a drink with me, Kent."</p>

<p>An uproarious twang of the samisens marked the end of the dance.
The guests clapped. The dancers sank to the floor, bowed in deep
salutation, ran down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> among the guests. The men rose from their places,
new groups formed. Kent was glad to escape. He went up to Kubota,
expressed his pleasure. He felt as if he must make some atonement for
Jones, wondered whether the Japanese had noticed him. He sensed a
soft pressure on his arm. It was the geisha who had first waited on
him at table. She had plucked from her hair an ornament, a cluster of
artificial flowers, curiously and intricately wrought, with little
polished metal bits faintly tinkling and glittering among the red
and purple petals. She offered it to him. "You are a nice stranger,"
she smiled up to him. "I want you to have this. It is a <i>katami</i>, a
souvenir." He glanced to Kubota, a little at a loss. The diplomat
laughed. "It is all right. Take it. It is an omen that Japan likes you.
I hope that you may like Japan."</p>

<p>It was getting late. The foreigners began to leave. The Japanese
remained behind. "They always do," commented Kittrick. "I have an idea
that now the real fun begins. But we never see it. Almost always only
the surface, here in Japan."</p>

<p>"He came near spoiling the evening, that man Jones," he remarked, as
they walked from the tea house. "Of course, he has a right to his point
of view, but why drag in the missionary question on such an occasion.
It made me angry. In fact, he made me say more about the missionaries
than I really meant."</p>

<p>Kent laughed. "It seems an odd thing how it crops up in all sorts of
incongruous places, isn't it; in steamer smoking rooms, in hotel bars.
Do you people really dislike them so?"</p>

<p>"It is a big jump from geisha to missionaries," said Kittrick. "Still,
since you ask, I should say that on the whole I don't. In some ways
the missionaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> do a lot of good for the standing of the white man
in the Orient, men like Doctor Wheelwright, for instance, men of
broad education and culture, who in a way serve as demonstrations to
the Japanese that the West, our race, has culture and high ideals,
something beyond mere lust for gain and pleasure. You know otherwise
the rest of us&mdash;most of us, at least&mdash;might easily give the Orientals
the idea that we are entirely materialists, that we stand a poor
comparison with their own scholars and men of culture. But then there
is the other class of missionaries, the fellows with little minds, who
can't see beyond the narrow vision they gained at their seminaries,
who are forever deploring what they call the evil example set by the
worldly white man, you and me, finding fault with our conduct, ever
criticizing us, and, for business reasons, taking the side of the
Japanese if we happen to criticize Japan. I feel as if the good done by
the one class is about evened up by the nuisance caused by the other.
I am thankful that I have friends among the first class; the others I
carefully avoid. As for the good they do among the Japanese, I don't
know. They undoubtedly do some good, but, on the other hand, personally
I can't help being a bit suspicious of the native Christian. So many
of them go in for Christianity on account of material advantages. It
is an easy way to learn English, for one thing, and then, undoubtedly,
many of them, the class of Japanese who want to be modern, who grasp
at any modern movement, be it French art, opera music, Communism, or
jazz, take up Christianity with sort of an idea that it is up-to-date,
<i>haikara</i> they call it. It is only fair to say, though, that all the
smoking-room talk you hear about the missionaries living at ease on
the fat of the land is largely rot. Most of them have to live modestly
enough, on mighty small salaries. I am willing to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> them credit,
most of them, of being sincere enough. I am neutral. I am willing to
let them alone, if they will leave me alone. There is the missionary
question in the Orient in a nutshell. Well, here I take my car. Give my
regards to Karsten&mdash;and to Jun-san. Good night."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>Kent drifted into his daily routine quickly and easily. His Japanese
clerk watched the papers for him, read over the headlines, and
translated into queer, but fairly understandable English the articles
which Kent called for. He had made friends with several Japanese
newspapermen, keen, elderly men, always pleasantly ready to comment
on and to amplify the news of the day, popular tendencies and drift
of thought, and who often took pains to keep him informed of the spot
news. Then he visited the departments, Foreign Office, Home Office,
War and Navy departments, a rather tedious and not very remunerative
procedure, interviewing second-rank officials, laboriously extracting
formal information, always meeting the unfailing courtesy and polite
blankness which makes the Japanese the hardest men to interview in the
world. The highest officials, Ministers, for instance, might as a rule
be interviewed only by submission of written questions. It seemed as if
the human element, the touch of man to man, was constantly deliberately
shrouded in an impenetrable veil of bureaucratic formalism. Was it
instinctive passion for secrecy, suspicion of the foreigner in general,
or merely the deadening influence of worship of official form? He could
not make up his mind, but he wished it were possible to talk frankly
and openly, with return in openness and frankness, and not always under
the peculiar feeling of restraint, of necessity of being constantly <i>en
guard</i>, as if one were fencing with an adversary in the dark. They were
always talking about frankness, about their desire for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> it, and yet he
felt that it was always one-sided, that all the frankness came from
the foreigner, but that for him there could be no penetrating through
an impalpable wall of instinctive reserve, into the real, innermost
thought of the Japanese.</p>

<p>Still, it was after all a pleasant life and, generally, an easy one. He
concluded that Japanese reserve was racial, rather than consciously,
deliberatively individual. And still there were times when they would
be surprisingly frank, almost incredibly outspoken. Even about such a
subject as the Imperial House they would sometimes, even officials,
like young Kikuchi, speak in terms entirely democratic, as would an
American, expressing carelessly ideas which he knew were well within
the "dangerous thought" category of the police. It amazed Kent, left
him a little at a loss as to how to reply, careful as he felt that
he must be in such matters. At first he thought that the opinions
were merely thrown out as bait, to draw him out, sound his views,
but he soon concluded that this was not the case, that the spread of
liberalism had extended far beyond the masses and was finding converts
among the young aristocracy, even among some of its older men. Some of
it was pose, he felt, the constant desire to show the foreigner that
Japanese were as advanced in modern thought as was he, but at the same
time he became convinced that substantially, generally, these men spoke
truthfully, just what they thought.</p>

<p>He was speaking about it one morning at his office, to Kittrick,
when the door opened noiselessly, and Terada appeared, drifted in,
floated in rather, as if without movement. He had introduced himself
a few weeks after Kent's arrival as an official of the police
department, whose business it was to keep a watchful eye on foreigners,
particularly correspondents. Since then he had come at intervals of
a few weeks. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> door would open, and he would enter, soundlessly,
almost apologetically. In his gray kimono, gray felt hat, he seemed
like a sort of genii out of Arabian Nights; it was almost as if
he materialized, a smoky, indefinite figure, mysteriously growing
out of the empty space of the room. It was his habit to make some
commonplace observation and then sit smoking, for ten minutes often,
before he would make his next remark, also quite commonplace, about
the weather, the cherry blossoms, anything. Thus he would sit for an
hour at a time, a courteous, self-effacing gentleman, saying something
entirely inconsequential; then smoking silently, thinking up his next
triviality. But out of the dozen or score of remarks would always be
one which Kent felt was the one that counted, the question which he
evidently hoped would pass unnoticed among all the others. Who was
going to be the new correspondent for the <i>Post</i>, what did he think of
the action of the Cabinet on such and such a matter? There would come
some more camouflage remarks, polite leave-taking, and he would vanish,
dissolve, fade away, leaving Kent to wonder whether he had really
managed to get any information that he had come for.</p>

<p>He made his usual remarks. Everything seemed to stop, while they waited
for him to frame the next one. It became a bore. Kittrick's patience
gave out.</p>

<p>"Do you really know so much about us foreigners, Terada-san?" he asked
banteringly. "What do you really find out about us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we know. You were at Ringo-san's tea house last Monday night, with
Sato-san, but you only stayed till ten," he smiled sourly. "You got
a new cook yesterday. Mr. Kent is to dine at Baron Saiki's to-morrow
night."</p>

<p>He smoked for a while silently. Then he faded away. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's a queer bird," said Kent, as Terada disappeared. "I'm sure I
don't see what he gets out of coming to me? His questions are too
transparent, with the main one so carefully sandwiched in among all the
rot that he so laboriously contrives. What does he do with it all, the
back-door gossip that he gathers so painstakingly?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it all goes down in reports, I daresay, good, bad and
indifferent," said Kittrick. "It is all stored away somewhere. It is
all a part of their marvelously ramified secret service system, which
they copied from Germany. It is a good system. On the whole, it is
a good idea for the authorities to keep track of every one, foreign
and Japanese, and I don't see why any one should object. The bad ones
should be watched. The innocent ones shouldn't mind; in fact, they get
protection from the others in that way. I know that some foreigners
object to the detectives, but the police are usually polite. Old-timers
who have detectives following them often make friends with them&mdash;you
know they don't hide the fact that they are trailing you&mdash;and use them
to buy railroad tickets, to help with the luggage; they are willing
enough to act as kind of free couriers. Of course, there are some
damned stupid officials who look on every foreigner as a potential
spy, but much of the talk of newcomers about their being followed by
detectives is buncombe. They like to think they are being shadowed. It
gives them a sense of importance."</p>

<p>"Ishii-san, run out and get me a package of Golden Bats, please." Kent
waited until the clerk had left the room. "I wanted to get him out of
the way," he explained to Kittrick. "The fact is that I know positively
that my desk is being systematically examined. I lock it; still I find
things disarranged. I keep nothing of consequence in it, but it annoys
me to have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> one constantly going through my private letters, and I
don't know who it can be."</p>

<p>"I don't think it is Ishii," said Kittrick. "I have reason to believe
that he is a young man inclined to have 'dangerous thoughts.' That is
one reason why I picked him out for you; so he wouldn't be a spy. It
is far more likely to be your good landlord. I'm pretty certain that
he is in Foreign Office pay. I have had several indications. Tokyo is
full of them, people who get information for the Foreign Office, the
Home Office, the police, the militarists. They are clerks, rickshaw
men, business men, high and low, all kinds. You see, they not only
copied the system, but they tried to elaborate on it. But all they
got, as usual, was the form, but not the intelligence. They go through
the motions of a secret service, but the whole thing is ramified in
numberless useless ways. They dovetail and overlap and get all kinds of
stupid information. I often wonder at what they do with all they get,
all the stuff about my being at a tea house and getting a new cook and
the like; but I think that it all goes down in reports, that many of
them don't care much what they get, as long as they get something they
can put in their reports, any old thing to fill the pages. And still,
you know, from all the trash they must undoubtedly get something worth
their while every now and then. At times you find evidences of really
skillful and clever work. And after all, why should you or I care?
They are discreet enough. Nothing comes out of what little foibles
they may learn about. Probably they don't care. Remember that, as far
as personal freedom is concerned, this is truly The Land of the Free,
where no one gives a hang if you have a drink or kiss a pretty geisha
behind the <i>shoji</i>."</p>

<p>"But how are they in business?" asked Kent. "Do they watch the stuff we
send out?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I knew. I think every correspondent wishes he knew," said
Kittrick. "Sometimes I think a copy of every cable we send goes to the
Foreign Office. There is no reason why it shouldn't; in fact, I can
see no great objection. Still, I never knew them to interfere with our
cables. I have sent stuff that I thought would be stopped; but it went
through. At the time of the so-called 'serious affair,' when old Prince
Yamagata tried to interfere with the engagement of the Crown Prince,
and the whole nation was whispering about it, and the censors were
working overtime to keep the thing quiet, I cabled the whole thing.
Now, if they ever interfere, they would have done it then; but the
cable went. I know most of us feel a bit suspicious, and once or twice
old Kubota has quoted almost word by word cables which I had sent the
day before. It may have been coincidence, but it is funny. It makes you
wonder. In fact, you will find that most of the fellows send mail stuff
that they want to be sure of, through friends who are going across to
the States, but, frankly, I don't actually know how far we are being
watched."</p>

<p>"By the way, I heard that you were going to dinner at the Saiki's," he
added. "If he is a friend of yours, you will find him a good one."</p>

<p class="space-above">Kent had hoped that the dinner at the Saiki's would be given in
Japanese style, that he might thus have an opportunity to get a glimpse
of the more intimate life in an aristocratic Japanese household, but
the moment he and Karsten drove into the grounds, it was plain that he
would be disappointed in this. The house was a large hybrid affair,
with a foreign style section and another part purely native, weird
and ungainly combinations which are becoming common in Tokyo and
which do their share in degrading the architecture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> the city. The
Japanese part lay in semi-darkness, but the other wing was brilliantly
lighted. Servants in foreign livery took their things, and they were
ushered into a large drawing-room, furnished punctiliously in French
fashion, almost too correct. One suspected immediately the hand of the
professional decorator behind it all. There was even less to indicate
Japan than is usual in foreign homes in Tokyo. The pictures, the
bric-a-brac, all was European. A splendid cloisonné vase in a corner
was the only bit characteristic of Japan; but then such a thing might
be found in any drawing-room in Paris or London. At table it was the
same,&mdash;a cocktail, then French courses, wines, decorations, served by
servants in black and gold livery. The kimonos of some of the women,
the high helmet-like coiffures of a few, served only to accentuate
the European atmosphere: and then some of the younger women, even
though they wore kimonos, dressed their hair in the foreign mode which
was becoming fashionable in Tokyo, the hair arranged, in its natural
softness, without the usual oily dressing, in soft rolls hiding the
ears.</p>

<p>Kent found himself seated between Baroness Saiki and Miss Suzuki.
Farther on sat young Kikuchi, then another Miss Suzuki, then Karsten,
with Kikuchi's sister at his right. Among the others were Templeton
of the <i>Express</i> and Butterfield of the <i>Times</i>. The rest were all
Japanese officials and their wives.</p>

<p>Conversation was carried on in English and Japanese. The men were
all fluent in English. The women, even when they spoke it, smiled
much, charmingly, but said little, seemed to be a peculiarly happily
contrived background rather than a material element of the affair.
Kent found himself absurdly ill at ease when Baroness Saiki insisted
on speaking Japanese. He knew that only few foreigners attain the
perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> where they may venture with safety to attempt the language
of the aristocracy, with its honorifics and a vocabulary containing
many words and idioms entirely different from those of the common
tongue. He felt as might a Frenchman who had learned his English on the
Bowery and who suddenly finds himself under necessity to speak with
a <i>grande dame</i> of ancient Boston lineage. He tried it, hesitantly,
fearing momentarily that he would make a <i>faux pas</i>; then he made a
clean breast of his trouble to her. She was amused, encouraged him to
go on; but even then it was irritatingly difficult to devise subjects
which might interest her. Books, the opera, mutual friends, all the
usual topics were useless. It was almost like trying to interest a
woman who had come forth, suddenly, from the seclusion of a seraglio.
Fortunately she had been abroad. He grasped at the usual banalities:
how did she find Japan after Washington and Paris. She answered
quietly, always smiling, charming, gracious; but she would reply in
only a sentence or two. Then he must find something new. She had
always, when he knew her on the steamer, been very quiet, discreetly
non-assertive, but even with that it seemed as if she had changed,
become even more retiring, self-effacing since she had come to Japan.
He had to think hard to devise pabulum for conversation and began to
get a little desperate. It was a relief when Kubota addressed her and
she turned to him.</p>

<p>It gave Kent an opportunity to speak to Miss Suzuki. He had been
relieved to see that she still wore foreign dress. Evidently her
family had not Japanized her to the extent of insisting on her wearing
kimono, as did her sister, an extremely pretty girl, in gorgeous silks,
with, however, her hair dressed in the modern mode. Kent was extremely
pleased to meet Miss Suzuki again; he had thought of her often and
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> wondered how he might manage to see her, but it had seemed oddly
impossible; there had seemed to be no way of contriving to meet her.
But she did not seem as spontaneously gay as she had been on the
<i>Tenyo</i>. Momentarily a hint of her American animation would appear
like a glint of heat lightning, a vivacious bit of high spirits, but
it flashed out, subdued into a vague, intangible quietness, smiling
gentleness, suggesting a sense of restraint, an almost imperceptibly
subtle change in manner and mind.</p>

<p>Baron Saiki addressed him from across the table, a matter of current
politics. Templeton and Kubota came into the discussion. Gradually
the conversation became general among the men, the presence of the
women being sensed, rather than forming an equal part, as a lovely and
delicately enchanting obligato beside the dominating pervasion of the
men.</p>

<p>Later, in the drawing-room, he found chance to meet the Suzuki
girls again. They formed a striking contrast, Kimiko, the younger,
resplendent in brilliant silks, gracefully drooping, wide kimono
sleeves, stiff brocade obi, recalling a picture of imagination, a
fanciful Oriental fairyland vision, picturesque, fantastic almost,
against the modestly cut pink evening gown of the sister. Here, removed
from the immediate presence of the others, she proved a lively,
capricious little damsel. She extended her hand frankly when the elder
girl introduced her to Kent.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that I am not modern, just because I speak no
English and have always lived in Japan," she flashed at him. "<i>Nous
sommes moderne, nous autres Japonnaises, n'est-ce-pas</i>, Kikuchi-san?"
It suited her. French harmonized better with her air of being a
resplendent illusion of whimsical imagination.</p>

<p>Kikuchi came over. "Of course, we are modern, <i>le dernier cri</i>. We
must show Kent. Now, how would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> it be if we all went to Tsurumi, to
Kagetsuen. We will show him how Japan and jazz mix. I am sure my sister
can fix it so you girls can go. Would you like it, Kent? I'm sure you
would. All right, I'll let you know the day later."</p>

<p>The girls were radiant. "You must not think, Mr. Kent, that because
we wear the kimono, we can't dance," bubbled Kimiko, protestingly. "I
have been dancing for two years now, even at some of the public places,
like Kagetsuen. But they are beginning to make a fuss about it, the
newspapers and the old fogeys. I hope they don't stop it. My sister has
never even been to Tsurumi. We'll have&mdash;what is it you say in English,
Tsuyuko, oh, yes, a hellu off a time."</p>

<p>"Oh, be careful," the sister glanced about hastily. "Kimiko is so crazy
to be modern that she wants to learn English phrases, and she likes the
swear words best, I'm sorry I taught her. She won't be careful. She is
irresponsible. Please pardon her. I wonder what Baroness Saiki would
say."</p>

<p>Karsten came over, but even his rather grave manner could not daunt
Kimiko-san. It seemed as if she wished to startle the sister, to
impress her with the fact that she, at least, was not old-fashioned.
"You look so grave, Mr. Karsten, so dignified, just like our
old-fashioned Japanese men. You should be a Japanese, and have a
Japanese wife, old-fashioned, of course. Would you like to have one?"
She was laughing up at him, like a pretty, mischievous child enjoying
its naughtiness.</p>

<p>Karsten laughed. "But I am so stupid about women. Now, if I do, will
you find me one, a pretty one? Will you be my <i>nakodo</i>, my go-between?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Of course, an old-fashioned man like you must have a
marriage by arrangement, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> a <i>nakodo</i>; but Tsuyuko and I,
when we marry, we are modern, we shall marry for love, <i>l'amour,
n'est-ce-pas?</i> We shall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ssst." Kikuchi made a quick warning gesture. Baroness Saiki came over
to them. There was no perceptible hush, but the bright sparkle of the
manner of the girls changed. They were still smiling, conversing, but
it was the gentle, quaint loveliness of the Orient. The moment of
glitter had gone. It was nothing as definite as palpable restraint
which had come over them; still there seemed to be an indefinite
barrier.</p>

<p>The groups broke up, changed, reformed. Every one left early. Kent
saw the girls again only when they took leave. He thought he sensed a
barely perceptible, still almost definite pressure of Kimiko's hand, as
she said good-by, the slightest hint of a glint in the dark brilliancy
of her eyes. But he could not be sure; he wondered.</p>

<p>The Saiki mansion was close to the Karsten house, and they walked home
in the moonlight, through the streets of the geisha quarter with the
opaquely lighted <i>shoji</i> contrasting, brilliantly white, against the
dark walls, tinkle of samisen and ripples of women's laughter coming
out to them in the night.</p>

<p>"Well, back in Japan again," said Kent. "For what we saw to-night
wasn't really Japan, was it? Still, it wasn't America or Europe either.
What do you think?"</p>

<p>"It is hard to say," said Karsten. "Even if what we saw to-night is not
Japan now, it is certain to become more and more so, while this&mdash;&mdash;" he
pointed to a <i>machiai</i> just ahead. The <i>shoji</i> had been drawn aside,
and they could see a geisha, resplendent in gold and crimson, languidly
posturing, fan slowly sweeping before her in obedience to the rhythm
of an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>unseen samisen in the background. "This is not the real Japan,
either. The other was Japan to-morrow. This is Japan yesterday. It is
difficult to say what is Japan to-day."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>Even as they made their way up the hill, among the booths, animal
cages, swinging bridges and slides of the amusement park which formed
an adjunct of the Kagetsuen, the crash and cry of the jazz orchestra
came down to them. Dancing began early and a number of couples filled
the floor of the large hall. The musicians, some fifteen of them, were
all Japanese, but they had mastered their peculiar art, the latest
phase of the modernity invading Japan. Emphasis seemed to have been
laid on modernity. With the exception of a few Japanese lanterns,
some characteristic masks, the arrangements were entirely in foreign
style. Wicker tables and chairs lined two sides of the hall, where tea
was served, English fashion. For a moment this modern air struck Kent
as disappointing. Then he looked about at the people, the dancers,
those sitting at the tables, and the feeling vanished. A glitter of
color shimmered and moved inside this tedious frame, brilliant kimono,
gorgeous obi, rich silk, blazing reds, radiant blues, color in all
shades and tints scintillating in motion. The colorless space, the
commonplace garb of the men, seemed rather to heighten the effect of
the exotic radiance of the women.</p>

<p>Kipling's "For East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall
meet" came to his mind. It might be true, but the scene before him
seemed to belie it. Was there ever such a melting-pot, raiment of a
civilization thousands of years old, substantially unchanged, absorbed
in the arms of extreme <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>modernism, the unimaginative West and the
evanescent romance of the Orient moving and mingling in the rhythm of
jazz. It was bizarre, discordant, but it made a picture odd, almost
incongruously anachronistic, but interesting, strikingly illustrative
of New Japan.</p>

<p>They found a table and sat down to tea, Kikuchi, his sister, the
Suzuki sisters and Kent. They made up programs, but Kent reserved only
a few dances. He wished to have opportunity to watch, to study this
heterogeneous potpourri of humanity.</p>

<p>Japanese predominated, the men all in European clothing, most of the
women in kimonos, though many wore foreign dress, generally simple,
but well tailored, becomingly worn. There were many Europeans and
Americans, nearly all men. It was difficult to determine their status;
they were so much alike, most of them in pongee. Of the women many were
apparently business girls, stenographers from Yokohama probably, though
here and there might be seen one a bit indeterminable, who caused the
mind to hesitate for a moment, in question.</p>

<p>Then there were the Eurasians, slim young men, inclined to be a shade
dandified, smooth, graceful dancers; the girls slim also, but with
a svelte luxuriance of body, a starry-eyed, almost tropical hint
of potentialities of fiery passion slumbering lightly behind their
sinuous grace. But, after all, his eyes would revert constantly to the
kimonos. They made the high light and luster of the scene, stirring
the imagination to wonder who were they, what were they, what were the
thoughts, the ambitions, the desires and passions, in these faintly
contoured breasts held tightly under silken folds above the stiff
brocade sashes? Difficult as it was to determine the character of the
others, Europeans and Eurasians, he felt <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>himself utterly baffled
by the Japanese women. Any one of them might be a daughter of the
aristocracy, or she might be a geisha, for all he could know. All the
usual minute signs, the hints conveyed by dress, speech and gesture
familiar in white women, the indescribable, subtle nuances, which
made it possible at home to distinguish between the gentlewoman and
the demimonde, were unknown to him here. It added to the fascination,
the bewildering sense of not being able to know, to determine, even
to guess with reasonable certainty, as if one were hesitatingly,
cautiously venturing into a marvelously fascinating, strange,
unexplored country.</p>

<p>A hundred questions clamored for explanations. Who was this one; what
could that one be? But his companions gave him little information. They
did not know these people, they said. Their tone conveyed to him that
he must restrain his curiosity. It was plain that they insisted on
being exclusive. They showed acquaintance with only one or two other
groups, a party, much like their own, in which young Watanabe, son of
the shipping magnate, was the leader; another composed of the sons
and daughters of wealthy silk merchants from Yokohama. These, quite
evidently, formed a set aside, remote from the gay throng about them.</p>

<p>He had indicated a girl who had passed them in the dance, rather
full-figured, Eurasian apparently, with large, languid eyes, who moved
with a slow swaying grace before them. It was the sense of dreamlike
voluptuousness that had attracted him.</p>

<p>"Eurasian. I hear she is a moving-picture actress," answered Kikuchi.
"It is democratic, you see. There are all kinds here, girls of gentle
birth and geishas, stenographers and actresses. It is queer to have
that kind of thing here in Japan, don't you think? Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> girls couldn't
come into such mixed company abroad, you know. But we must dance, and
there are only these places, this and a few smaller ones in Tokyo; and
the management is strict; in fact, I believe they pretend to keep out
the geisha element, though I'm sure they wink at their coming so long
as they behave themselves. It is really entirely respectable, and our
girls are quite all right here so long as we keep to ourselves."</p>

<p>Kent took the hint. He would have liked to have mingled at close range
with the others, to venture into the tangle of dazzling, mysterious
femininity where your partner of chance might turn out to be a
demoiselle of ancient samurai lineage or a motion-picture queen, a
stenographer or a geisha. Still, he enjoyed his growing intimacy with
the girls in his own party. The fact that they were confined mainly to
their own circle brought them together, made it necessary to dance more
often with his companions than would otherwise have been the case. He
found special pleasure in Kimiko-san. It was his first experience in
dancing with a girl in kimono. He enjoyed the strange sense of grasping
about the thick, stiff obi; it was something new. He was surprised at
her agile vivacity. The orchestra was playing an amazing adaptation
of "Zigeunerweisen," stolen almost bodily by the enterprising
pseudo-composer, retaining the gipsy fire and sparkle of the original,
and she seemed to radiate the electric tingle, the flushing abandon
thereof, confusing with the sense of odd contrast of hot, pulsing
passion contained within the feudal conventionality of her gorgeous
costume.</p>

<p>They sat out the next dance. They were alone at their table. "Do you
like to dance with me? Can I dance?" Her eyes flashed at him.</p>

<p>"It is marvelous. It seems so impossible that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> can be so wonderful.
And in <i>zori</i>; how do you do it?"</p>

<p>She laughed, delighted, looked about. Then she slipped from her small
foot, clad in <i>tabi</i>, the mitten-like white silk covering which takes
the place of a stocking, a <i>zori</i>, sandal-like flat footgear, held in
place by cross bands. She passed it to him in the shadow of the table.
"See, it is slit. We have them made especially for dancing."</p>

<p>It seemed almost impossible that this might be such a prosaic thing as
a shoe, this dainty, small object in his hand, surfaced with figured
crimson and gold brocade, like a precious work of art, with its red
silk cross bands.</p>

<p>"It simply adds to the illusion," he told her. "Out of the mysterious
Orient has come to me a gorgeous Cinderella slipper."</p>

<p>"Who is Cinderella?"</p>

<p>He explained, tritely and mechanically at first, restrained by the
oddness of bringing forth such a puerility. But she was interested,
leaned towards him intently. He warmed to the telling. How was it
possible that she might be so interested in such a simple thing? A
moment ago she had been a woman, palpitating, warm, in his arms. Now
she was a child, listening with eager wonder to a fairy tale. What was
she; what were they, anyway, these girls,&mdash;children or women, or both?
He enjoyed her intentness; tried to apply in the telling all the skill
and artistry that he could contrive.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lovely story! I didn't know you could tell stories. You
must tell me many more. I love it." She was radiantly delighted. It
pleased him immeasurably. It would be a novel thing, a new experience
in life, to recall to memory the half-forgotten childhood tales and to
dress them up for her, in terms suitable to fanciful Oriental setting,
enjoying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> tremulous reactions which he might thus cause in this
beautiful creature with the clear, innocent mind of a child, clothed in
the budding curves of the body of a woman.</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment, then she placed her hand on his arm.
"But you still have my <i>zori</i>."</p>

<p>He had forgotten it. It lay in his hand, absurdly small and elegant.
"If it were not really necessary for you to have it, I should like to
keep it, as a souvenir, a reward for my story."</p>

<p>"But I can't give it to you now, you know," she was smiling, with
just a shade of seriousness. "But you shall have your reward, if you
really want such a trifling thing as this, for I wish to have many more
stories from you. You must see me often and tell me many just like
Cinderella."</p>

<p>After that telling stories to Kimiko-san became a regular part of
their evenings at Tsurumi. They came often, and he fell into the habit
of thinking up his tales in advance, finding his themes among the
rich treasures of the West, from mythology and history, folk tale and
medieval romance, even from the Old Testament. It amused him to take
the essential dramatic values, coloring the action so as to render it
understandable to the Japanese mind, dressing the material in Oriental
form. Samson became a valiant samurai and Delilah a perfidious geisha.
Hercules performed his prodigies in the atmosphere of the legendary
<i>Momotaro</i>. He became interested as the thought began to take definite
form that here was an idea that he might some day work out into more
concrete shape, and in the meantime he enjoyed the breathless interest,
the childishly intent response which he always awakened in the girl.</p>

<p>It brought them closer together. Their intimacy became recognized
gradually by tacit understanding in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> their little group. He became her
acknowledged cavalier. He wondered at times why this girl had become so
much more attractive to him than the elder sister. He was still fond
of Tsuyuko-san, but the feeling remained the same, neither increasing
nor decreasing, while he sensed that Kimiko-san and he were coming
constantly nearer to each other, more intimately parts of each other's
thoughts. Could it be that what attracted was in its intrinsic essence
the glamor of the East, the charm of the seductive, unknown Orient?
The question would come to his mind&mdash;were they drifting towards a more
definite relation; might not the love element already be germinating,
unconsciously developing? He recalled the words of Miss Elliott that
these girls were not children, that they were moved and driven by the
same passions as those which dominate the more sophisticated women of
the West. But he put the thought from him. His moral code was a simple
and rigid one. He was married, and he must keep the faith. Even though
marriage had been a failure, as long as the bond existed he would play
the game. He, at least, would keep his record clean, and while the
relation remained there would be no dalliance for him with other women.
So in the case of Kimiko-san, as with other women, there could be no
question of love relations. There were times when a lingering of her
hand, a sidelong glance from dark almond eyes would cause a nervous
titillation of agreeable unrest, would quicken his blood, give a
flashing hint of something pleasantly, subtly dangerous, but sweet; but
it was so evanescent, so intangible. The next moment she would be the
gay, virginal child.</p>

<p>He felt that it was rather stupid, an absurd exaggeration of caution;
still he had made opportunity to tell her of his wife, in California;
but she had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> been interested. "Oh, she is far away," had been her
only comment, carelessly laughing, with no accentuation of meaning;
and she had turned instantly to light chatter of the moment. Quite
apparently it meant nothing to her. So the play kept on. He allowed
himself to take pleasure from her radiant presence, her beauty, to
rest his eye on her flower-like features, dark eyes, to enjoy the
slenderness of her fingers, sense the palpitating magnetism of her
lithe body and inhale the perfume of her hair, as he held her, swaying,
in the rhythm of the dance. He felt pleasure in the thought that he
might enjoy all this rich beauty, as one might that of a flower, a
butterfly, unvitiated by sordid taint of sex interest.</p>

<p>But his delight in the charm of Kimiko-san did not dull his interest
in the others, the great throng of women, shimmering about him in
their glimmering silks, unknown, mysterious to him. They piqued his
curiosity. He wanted to know who they were, what they were, what were
their lives, their thoughts, to come to know them as intimately as did
these care-free youths who held them in the dance, chattered gayly
with them at the tables. He felt as if he were being withheld from the
familiarity of the charmed circle, resented a little the restraint
which he was under when he was with Kimiko-san and her sister. Finally
he decided that he would come alone. Lüttich seemed to be there
always. Through him he would contrive himself to become a part of this
marvelously fascinating butterfly whirl of strangely unknown femininity.</p>

<p>So he came alone, one afternoon, and sought out Lüttich.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to show you about," said the Russian, "but the fact is
that I have little time. I am busy. You see, I am here professionally.
For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> moment, at least, dancing has taken the upper hand over music
with young Japan, so I have become a dancing teacher. I have more
than I can do. I dance from morning till night, giving lessons. It is
not bad. They learn more easily than you would think. Then, when they
become a bit proficient, I take them out here; but I must dance with
them myself, at first, to give them confidence. A lot of these girls,
and men, too, for that matter, are my pupils. So you see I am busy as a
matter of duty. <i>N'importe.</i> It pays, and one must live.</p>

<p>"However, let us sit down for a moment. Have a drink." He called a
boy. "You want to know who they are. Well, they are a mixed crowd.
All kinds; that's part of the charm, is it not? See that pretty young
woman over there, just passing the pillar. She is the wife of the
Buddhist priest of the big temple on the other side of the hill.
The young fellow with her is an American boy in some company in
Yokohama. Priestess and office clerk. Odd, isn't it? Bizarre. Still, I
daresay mighty few of them realize it, or give it a thought. See that
cadaverous Eurasian with his Japanese wife? They are pupils of mine.
They dance well, don't they? Well, two years ago they had never danced
a step. Now that is all they do; it is their whole life interest, a new
step, the latest fox-trot. You can still see when she walks that she
has not gotten over the duck-walk that they get from Japanese <i>geta</i>;
but you don't see it when she dances. These two have reduced life to
terms of fox-trot. That has become their sole standard of measurement;
they regard people as good or bad, according to how well they dance."</p>

<p>It was interesting. "Tell me about more of them," said Kent. "I have an
absolutely insatiable curiosity."</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can, when I get the chance, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> as I told you&mdash;&mdash;" He
caught by the arm a young chap who was passing. "Here, Dick, I want you
to look after my friend, Kent. He wants to know some of the girls. Show
him about." He turned to Kent. "Dick here can do the honors better than
I can. He knows nearly all of them. Duty calls, I am off. Be good."</p>

<p>Dick grinned pleasantly. Kent had noticed him often, a slim, vivacious
man of about thirty, always laughing behind his small mustache,
radiating effervescent vitality, infectiously bubbling over with joy of
life.</p>

<p>"First of all you must know Madame Hirano," he said. "She's the boss.
It pays to be on the good side of her. She rules with a hand of iron
in a velvet glove, not so much velvet, either, if she should catch
you here with a girl too much on the off side. Then she'd give you
the quick bounce. She's done it often enough. But she's a good fellow
really. Come along over and I'll introduce you."</p>

<p>They went over to a corner where the tyrant had a place of vantage,
whence she might survey the entire hall. She was an elderly woman,
handsomely dressed. As she sat there, surrounded by a small court of
girls from the neighborhood, attached in an indefinite way to the
establishment, with her sharp, black eyes constantly roving among
the dancers, it was easy to see that here was one of these rather
exceptional Japanese women with will power and executive ability; that
she was, as Dick had said, the "boss."</p>

<p>She acknowledged the introduction graciously, with the slightest hint
of condescension, consciousness of her power. It was evidently in
Kent's favor that he was a newspaperman. She told him, annoyedly, of
the inimical attitude towards foreign dancing of the Japanese press.
They were so stupid, she complained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> so old-fashioned. He began to ask
her questions about the dancers. She looked at him sharply, as if a bit
suspicious. He explained his motive&mdash;curiosity&mdash;how all these types
which were familiar to her were strange to him. He wanted to become
acquainted with the new woman of Japan. For instance, he should like
to meet some of the motion-picture actresses, a type which seemed so
characteristic of the most modern tendencies of the country.</p>

<p>Yes, some of them came here, she acknowledged, but she let it go at
that, and gave him no information. He tried to press the subject. A
slight, vivacious girl, in a splendid kimono in the black and white
checkerboard-like pattern which was fashionable that year, fox-trotted
nimbly past them. He had often noticed the passionate pleasure which
she took in the dance, the cat-like grace with which she swung her body
in intoxicated undulations, clinging to her partner, smiling up to him,
teeth flashing in an alluring smile&mdash;a Japanese Theda Bara, it seemed
to him. There now, he ventured, was undoubtedly a lady of the screen.</p>

<p>"But no," she was shocked, with quick intake of breath. "What a
mistake. That is a <i>go-fujin</i>, a lady of good, oh, extremely fine
family. Certainly not."</p>

<p>Kent saw he had made a <i>faux pas</i>. He was glad when the cadaverous
dance-mad Eurasian led her off into the dance.</p>

<p>Dick was laughing. "You certainly got off on the wrong foot, Kent. I'd
better do the honors. I know most of them. I ought to. I have lived
here all my life. So, fire away."</p>

<p>It was fascinatingly interesting. He was a complete "Who's Who," able
to sketch in a few sentences the entire curriculum <i>vitæ</i> of most of
the dancers, <i>go-fujin</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> actresses, stenographers, married women, rich
men's daughters, geisha, girl students, who they were, whence they
came, approachable or otherwise. Before them, past them, moved the
dancing couples, unconscious of the fact that their lives were being
laid bare, their characters stripped, good-naturedly, laughingly, but
with a sure, quick touch.</p>

<p>"That girl in pink foreign dress, with pink slippers, that's one of the
Thompson girls, Eurasians; father is in silk. They live in Honmoku.
There are three of them, but one's married. That one, in red, the one
with the pink beads, that's a stenographer with the Standard Oil in
Yokohama. Now, that one, with the big, gold obi, I am not quite sure,
but I think she is geisha. They say she's from Shimbashi. It is odd,
you know, most of the fuss in the Japanese papers has been stirred
up by the geisha guilds. They are afraid that if the men get used to
foreign dancing, it will raise the devil with the geisha business, that
they will come to these dances instead of spending fifty or a hundred
yen an evening on geisha. And still the geisha themselves can't keep
away from the dance places. The lure has got them, too."</p>

<p>He went on. One after one these elusive, dazzling women, who had so
baffled Kent's ventures at guessing, were singled out for brief,
concise description, as if they were picked out individually, suddenly,
by a searchlight, moving hither and yon in the throng, illuminating
each one in intense glare for a moment, then allowing her to slip back
into the background of the crowd, as the beam shifted to, rested on,
stripped the mystery from another kimono-clad enigma; then moved on to
still another.</p>

<p>"Now, there are the Kincaids," he went on. Kent had been curious to
know who they were, a middle-aged, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>quiet American, and a young woman,
whose kimono, with its marvelously delicate texture, glorious though
subdued luxuriance, was noticeable even in that dazzling kaleidoscope
of rich Oriental stuffs. He had taken the man to be some wealthy
foreigner, "import and export" man probably, who took pleasure in
showering his wealth on this slight, fairy-like beauty, to indulge his
fancy by arraying her in constantly changing ornate frames for her
enchanting loveliness.</p>

<p>"Kincaid is a teacher in one of the most exclusive girls' schools in
Tokyo," Dick was going on. "She was a pupil there, comes from an old
samurai family, blood blue as indigo, but family estates, riches,
glory, the whole business gone, all but pride, tenacious grasp on
the old traditions. She's a beauty, isn't she? Exquisite. Kincaid
was smitten. How he ever managed to see her alone is a mystery. It
was romance. Imagine yourself, in this day of wireless and gasoline,
conducting a courtship after the fashion of feudalism, the infinitely
obscure and meaningless <i>minutiæ</i> of the days of the Shogunate. It
can't have been anything else. The family must have insisted on it.
Kincaid is a deep Oriental scholar. He could do it if any one could.
He may even have enjoyed it, taken it as a sort of top examination, a
supreme test, if he thought of it in that light. I don't know. Nobody
knows just what he went through. But he had the devil's own time.
Luckily, he had influential Japanese friends, blue-blooded, too, but
modern, and they helped him out. And then the girl was infatuated with
him, crazy after him. You know they get all kinds of new ideas, these
girls, Socialism, free love, careers of their own, art, literature,
foreign husbands, it may be one fad or another, anything. Hers
evidently was a foreign husband, or, at least, Kincaid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> So at last the
family gave in; but that was only half the game. Then came the wedding.
It had to be Japanese style, most formal ritual, <i>san san kudo</i>, three
times three cups of sake drunk by bride and groom and all that. That
didn't bother Kincaid. Probably he liked it. But the expense! You know
these high-class Japanese weddings sometimes run up to hundreds of
thousands of yen. There are all kinds of expensive gowns for the bride,
kimonos, obi, ornaments, God knows what. Then the banquet, hordes of
guests, at fifteen, twenty, thirty yen a plate, something like that.
And then, finally, the presents. You know in Japan the wedded folk
must give return presents, usually about twice the value of those they
get. You get married. I give you something utterly useless, a vase, a
<i>kakemono</i>, and then you must come back with something quite as useless
but worth twice the price. They say it cost Kincaid thirty thousand
yen, which wasn't so bad under the circumstances. He spent every yen
he had. That was over two years ago, and they are still saving, paying
off their wedding debts, living in a couple of rooms. She does most
of the housework, but they are both happy. You can see it. He gets
his pleasure taking her here and there, his prize, in her wonderful
kimonos, the trousseau, intensely proud of her; and she adores him.
Look at her. Her eyes are always on him. She has realized her dream; he
has his. No room for regret, no thought of it. Romance, the new, modern
West and the age-old East, they have become one. So it works sometimes."</p>

<p>The orchestra blared into a new dance. Dick went off for a partner
somewhere in the other end of the hall. Kent leaned back, summarizing,
trying to classify his new knowledge. In a way the glib explanations,
the reduction into terms of commonplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> of these people, these women,
dimmed the picture a little, detracted from its attraction of being
unknown; still, he had had but a glimpse behind the veil. What he had
learned would but serve to initiate him further, to penetrate more
deeply, to insinuate himself more intimately into this attractive,
strange world of utterly foreign thoughts, fashions, modes of life.</p>

<p>Behind him, in the garden outside, staring through the open windows, a
fringe of Japanese, the ordinary folk who found their pleasures in the
slides, and swings and other marvels of the park, were discovering rare
entertainment in watching the dancers, the strange new foreign custom
of women, gentlewomen at that, dancing together with, in the arms of,
men. Abstractedly he listened to their churlish comment.</p>

<p>"They have the luck, these chaps," a burly fellow of the rickshaw man
type nudged his friend. "For two yen they can put their arms about
these girls, pretty girls, ladies. It's cheaper and better fun than
playing with geisha."</p>

<p>The voice of a woman cut in; her hair, dressed high, with a great,
heavily oiled knot, proclaimed that she was married. "I don't like it.
It's dirty."</p>

<p>A girl sitting next to Kent laughed. She had noticed that he had caught
the remark. "Funny, isn't it?" she remarked to him. He aroused himself
from his thoughts. He had not noticed her. It was the priestess. She
chatted on. He had not been introduced, but, would she dance? Why,
certainly; he was a friend of Dick's. So he found himself in the
midst of the whirl, enjoying the thought that he, himself, had now
become part of this bewildering inconsistency, fox-trotting with a
Buddhist priestess, absurd, amusing, but delectable. She danced with
full-bodied enjoyment, chatting vivaciously, with a nimble, flash-like
wit. When they had returned to their seats, he led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> her to tell him
about the others. She knew them well, as did Dick, but he enjoyed her
characterizations, the Japanese point of view.</p>

<p>The full-figured Eurasian girl, whose dreamy voluptuosity had attracted
his attention the first night, when he had been with the Suzuki
girls, passed in the dance, nodded over her partner's shoulder to the
priestess.</p>

<p>"Do you know that girl? I hear she is a motion-picture actress?"</p>

<p>"<i>Naruhodo</i>," she was noncommittal. "Yes, I see her often here. I have
spoken to her."</p>

<p>"Then introduce me, please. I know so few people here."</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment, overcame her doubts. "All right, come."</p>

<p>The dance had finished. The girl was sitting at one of the large
tables, with two or three other girls and some young foreigners. He
hesitated in his turn. It was a bit awkward. Still, the die had been
cast. He must see it through. The priestess laid her hand on his
sleeve. "This is Mr. Kent. He wants to meet you."</p>

<p>The girl nodded to him slightly, looking at him, her big eyes wide in
surprise. The others at the table stared. Utter silence. He wished he
were a hundred miles away. But he was in for it. "Please, Miss &mdash;&mdash;"
Hang it, the priestess had not even given her name. He slid over it. "I
am quite strange here. I wonder if you would be kind enough to give me
a dance?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry. My dances are all taken." The others still stared. He
bowed. The priestess was already in retreat. He trailed after her, to
the corner of the lady tyrant. Damn it. He bit his lip in resentment.
Who was she, this Eurasian, to hold <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>herself too high, too precious,
as if he were not good enough for her? Still, of course, the girl was
right. What a fool he was immediately to think of race, when he had
always insisted, did, in fact, maintain that he had no race prejudice.
Good for her, whoever she might be. But he had been an ass. He had made
a bad beginning.</p>

<p>Dick appeared. Kent told him. He laughed. "By Jove, but that's funny.
You do need a guardian. The moment I leave you, you start adventuring
on your own. That's a very respectable girl, a stenographer in Tokyo,
nice parents, you know. She's no motion-picture lady. You can't do like
that. If you are so anxious to meet the motion-picture folk, why didn't
you tell me. The fact is that there are a couple right here. I had sort
of a halfway date with them. Come on. We'll take them to dinner down in
one of the tea houses below in the park. You eat Japanese chow, don't
you?"</p>

<p>The two girls were at a table at the farther end of the hall. He had
noticed them often. One of them, the elder, he had guessed to be
professional of some sort, theatrical, because of her kimono, a bit
too bright, and especially her unusual coiffure, after some eccentric
foreign fashion, in a mode which he had never seen, a sort of high,
long cone, reminiscent of an Assyrian helmet, which showed to advantage
her luxuriant hair, black with a faint tinge of chestnut, effective,
but odd. The other was one of the girls who had eluded classification.
She had puzzled him, with her large, voluptuous mouth, slow smile
showing teeth which might really be described as pearly, but with her
quiet manner, almost diffident, giving the lie to those sensuous lips.</p>

<p>"O-Tsuru-san. Kin-chan." There was no trouble over these introductions.
The girls laughed, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> room at the table. "No," said Dick. "It's time
to eat. Let us go below."</p>

<p>The tea house was typically Japanese. They slipped off their shoes
and squatted down at a low table, on <i>zabuton</i>. The girls were at
ease, friendly. He felt as if he had known them for years. Kin-Chan,
the elder, evidently lived for excitement. She drank continuously.
"Dick-san," she complained, "we should have had a koku-tail before we
came down here, but, never mind, we'll have some by-and-by."</p>

<p>She chattered incessantly, flitting from subject to subject, light
gossip of Tokyo, dancing, acting, kimono styles, fashions in rings&mdash;she
let it be known that she was fond of rubies set in platinum&mdash;places
to go to, hot spring resorts, how she liked foreigners, the wiles of
geisha. It amused him to listen to her. As they went back to the dance
hall, up the hill, she leaned on his arm confidentially. The perfume
from her hair came to him pleasantly. He inhaled it, enjoying it, and
her warm, close presence, the bewildering chatter affording flash-like
glimpses of the mind of an engaging phase of modern feminine japan.</p>

<p>As they danced, she chattered on, touched on this subject and that,
one thought crowding away the other before it had been more than half
expressed, giving him a sense as were he surrounded, enveloped, in
an aura of bright, strange, girlish musings, a glimmering of myriad
fragmentary ideas, oddly, entrancingly interesting. He was beginning to
learn what lay inside these budding breasts under the tensely tightened
kimono silks&mdash;at last.</p>

<p>The other girl said little, smiled, with glimmer of white teeth behind
her full, soft lips, but she seemed to absorb her pleasure by feeling
it, through the senses, silently. Little by little he tried to induce
her to tell about herself. Was she, too, a motion-picture actress?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> Oh,
no! She went to higher school. She lived with her parents.</p>

<p>He mentioned it to Dick, in English. It was delightfully safe, even
right in front of the girls.</p>

<p>"She's a liar," said Dick bluntly. "She's an actorine of some sort at
the Imperial. Probably a minor one. I don't know. But in a way she's my
girl, for the present. She probably wants to throw you off, to hold you
off. They have more guile than you think, these girls, behind all their
childishness."</p>

<p>So Kin-chan, Little-Gold, fell to Kent, and he saw the girls home, to
Tokyo, as Dick lived in Yokohama. He enjoyed Kin-chan, arranged with
her to come to Tsurumi again. After that, when the Suzukis could not
come, she was often his companion.</p>

<p>He found constant pleasure in studying her thoughts, in seeing Japan,
Japanese life, through Japanese eyes; learned that in her he might
experience a frankness which could never be obtained from the men.
It was evident that she liked him. At times she even quite openly
encouraged him, as if she were impatient with his slowness in response.
As they became more intimate, she told, without reserve, of her life.
Impatience at the drudgery and bonds of a lower middle-class family.
Then she had begun to go to foreign motion-picture shows. At first it
had been the pictures of foreign children which had taken her fancy.
<i>Kawaii</i>; they were so dear! So she had run away, to Yokohama, where
there were many foreigners. She had wanted to take care of children.
Then, after a while, she had become an actress.</p>

<p>Gradually, as their friendship became older, she gave more detail.
He was amazed at the frankness with which she displayed to him her
intimate life. At last, one evening when they were alone in a discreet
little tea house in Tokyo to which she had taken him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>&mdash;she had become
his wondrously efficient guide into the innermost mazes of the great
rambling metropolis&mdash;she threw an arm about his neck, as they were
sitting at a window, looking out over the roofs and told him about
herself.</p>

<p>It was a girl friend who had persuaded her to come to Yokohama, and she
had taken her to a house, a bad house, where foreigners came. She had
been frightened, she had cried. She had wanted to return home; but she
was afraid of the parents. And it had been a nice class of foreigners
who had come there. They had treated her courteously, been kind to her,
kinder than the Japanese men had been at home. So&mdash;<i>shikataganai</i>, it
couldn't be helped. But she had hated it. She had stayed only a few
months. She had learned to be independent. And then luck had come her
way. One of the foreigners, who was in Japan selling American films,
had obtained employment for her with a Japanese company which made
pictures. Oh, that wasn't the end; she smiled bitterly. The Japanese
men were just like the rest, one must let them have their way if one
would succeed. "But now I have succeeded, and I can be independent of
them. And I am. There are only half a dozen real Japanese stars, and
I am one of them. Pictures of me go abroad. I get two hundred yen a
month."</p>

<p>It surprised him, the wage, so infinitesimally small as compared with
the fortunes harvested by the Pickfords, the Chaplins, in the United
States. Why?</p>

<p>"Oh, it is these Japanese men. They never want to give us women a
chance. They won't advertise our names. They won't feature us, as
they do in America. They are afraid that then we should get popular
and ask for more money." But she was impatient at the interruption.
This phase of the matter was not what she wanted to dwell on. "I don't
like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> Japanese men. They don't treat us nicely, courteously, as do you
foreigners. If they do, it is only in the beginning. In the end, very
soon, they are all the same. I like foreigners. I am not a bad girl any
more. I never wanted to be. But, sometimes I feel that I should like a
sweetheart, a foreign sweetheart, who would love me, as foreigners do,
and be good to me&mdash;&mdash;" The clasp of the arm about his neck tightened.
The fragrance from her hair, the subtle, evanescent perfume which he
delighted in, which had become to him characteristic of her, became
overpoweringly sweet. She would be his. She was his now, if he cared
to take her. They were tempting, these Japanese girls, with their
quaint, childlike ways, unsophisticated, even though this one had
passed through the mud. The charm of the Japanese women! Kimiko-san
flashed into his mind. It was difficult to hold out against their
seductiveness. Still, he had made up his mind to play the game with his
wife. And yet? He felt that he was hovering. How deliciously soft she
was as she clung to him, closer.</p>

<p>The sliding door behind them clattered. A maid came in. The tenseness
dissipated. It was like a shock in its suddenness. Trite common sense
came back to him, over him, like a shower of cold water, irritating,
but dominatingly. By Cæsar, it had been a close call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>The return to Tokyo of Sylvia Elliott at this very time seemed an
especially kind dispensation of Providence. Kent had seen practically
nothing of her since his arrival in Japan. In his eagerness to immerse
himself in the Japanese life, to steep himself therein, he had felt
as if he had no time for intermingling with the foreign element, had
almost resented its intrusion where he had not been able to avoid
it. The whites, Americans, British, French and the rest were, after
all, commonplace, incapable of affording the stimulus of the new, the
attraction of the unknown, the piquancy of the constant zest to peek
and penetrate beyond the mysteries behind the <i>shoji</i>. He had known
people like that all his life; now, in Japan, he wanted to be with the
Japanese; in that way only was it possible to attain to the full the
charm of living in a foreign country, strange, picturesque, exotic, to
taste with the critical appreciation with which a connoisseur sips a
rare vintage, in slow sips, the impressions and sensations derivable
from the colorful life stirring all about him.</p>

<p>And then she had been in the country most of the time, on sketching
tours in the mountain regions about Nikko, Chuzenji, Ikao. He had
noted with half-attentive curiosity that in spite of his instinctive
avoidance of the foreign element he was pleased to see her again, that
she formed an exception. As he came to see her more often, he was
surprised, delighted, that instead of intruding as a discordant note
in the symphony of life which he was trying to compose by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> blending
his life in tune to his surroundings, she fitted herself into it, even
enhanced his pleasure therein. She had the capacity for enjoyment, the
appreciative understanding of the essential soul of Japan, which is so
rare with foreign women, who, though their eye for beauty admits and
even admires the charm of carved temple gate, or picturesquely gnarled
pine projecting from rocky crag, stop short with the externals, refuse
to extend sympathetic understanding to the people themselves, the
Japanese, blinded by the instinctive resentment of the white woman at
the competitive charm of womankind of another race. She had none of
that. As he did, so she chose to overlook the blots that they might not
disturb her enjoyment of the colors. Possibly it was that the artist in
her was stronger than the woman. He concluded that it must be so&mdash;but
what was the difference! He found that when he was with her, delight in
the discovery of beauty, of landscape, a bit of garden, the harmonious
blending of color in a woman's dress, or even a beautiful face, became
heightened, keener, as if concentrated, more clearly defined, through
the doubled capacity for appreciation of two minds which functioned
harmoniously as one.</p>

<p>For a while they saw much of each other, were constantly together on
expeditions into the surrounding country, or, oftener, on haphazard
rambles through remote quarters of the great, labyrinthic capital,
voyages of discovery in unknown streets where every turn of the road
might lead to new adventure, or bizarre incident which might be added
to the treasures in their common storehouse of memories. They delighted
to lose themselves entirely in some section unfrequented by foreigners,
where one might wander about through the whole day without seeing a
white face, and then to exercise their ingenuity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> finding their way
precariously through the maze to some guiding landmark.</p>

<p>"My God, if my wife had only been like that," or rather, he hastened
to amend the thought, if only Isabel had been with him and he might
have taught her, guided her to become like this. But instantly his
intelligence interrupted disturbingly; Isabel couldn't. She would be
like the majority of the women, instinctively antagonistic, magnifying
the stupidity of a cook, the petty rascality of a peddler to the point
where they warped her entire view of all Japan. It persisted as a voice
clamoring at him, and he forced himself to try to think otherwise, as
if he might, by forced violence of the voice of his will, over-shout,
drown utterly the insistent sardonic irony of his intelligence.</p>

<p>So he came to compel himself to resist the thought, to think of other
matters, politics, money, even to work out in his head mathematical
problems. But it was difficult at times. After a day with Sylvia,
permeated with her presence, returning through winding lanes, past
bamboo fences, when the thrill of cicadas mingled with the whimper
of unseen samisen, and the moonlight transformed the world into a
glamorous black-and-white tracery of silhouetted branches, sharply
drawn roof-tree contours standing out against a translucent sky, his
entire being would be singing within him, and he would step lightly,
head thrown back, whistling, enamored with the world, with life.</p>

<p>And then like a pang, sharply, suddenly, like a stitch in the side,
would snap into his brain the inspiration of the devil: "Why all this
gayety?" It was as if the damnable thought took shape, personified
itself into a hideous, leering, grinning imp, with an insidious
wink. "You fool, of course, you are in&mdash;&mdash;" But he was used to it,
was on guard, too quick for the imp; would fling him a mental kick,
indignantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> "Shut up, of course, I am not, you beast." But again, "It
is no use. You can't deceive me. You can't even deceive yourself. You
know damned well that you are in&mdash;&mdash;" Would come again violation of his
thoughts to calculation of algebra, enumeration of bills due at the end
of the month, any beastly thing. He had even tried to think tenderly
of Isabel, to recall the high lights of courtship, red-letter days of
early marriage, to try to conjure a reluctant hope, to compel himself
to wish that she might come back to him, make another attempt to blow
into flame the ashes of dead love.</p>

<p>For, of course, he did not love Sylvia. He snapped his defiance back
into the teeth of the grinning satyr-face popping forth, irritatingly,
from the corners of his mind. He did not love her&mdash;with thought of her
came weakness, softness&mdash;at least, he could not love her, would not.
It was impossible; not to be thought of. So long as he was married to
Isabel, he would play the game, keep his side of the slate clean, not
place himself in the wrong. Popped into his mind an incident of a few
days before. He had been dancing with Sylvia at a tea dance at the
Imperial Hotel. The orchestra leader, slim, debonair, one of these men
who seem capable of radiating vitality, joy of life, had been singing,
eyes flashing across the length of his fiddle, leaning forward towards
the couples swaying to his rhythm before him, infusing them with his
flame. It had been a trivial thing, one of the myriad of new fox-trots
which spring forth like lush weeds, the words utterly banal. As Hugh
was passing, he had glanced up, his eyes had met those of the happy
fiddler for the flash of a moment, and as he sang the words, the silly,
inane stuff, "When you play the game of love, are you playing fair,"
he had laughed to him. It seemed almost as if there had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> the
slightest suggestion of a knowing wink, conveying the suggestion that
he, the fiddler, was sharer of a secret between the two, and as if he
had, friendlily insinuating, tilted his head toward Sylvia. Even at the
moment, Kent had been certain that it was all a play of imagination,
a trumpery pleasantry sardonically contrived by his accursed imp
familiar, but the thing had stuck in his mind with absurdly exaggerated
force.</p>

<p>Confound it! It was exactly the opposite thing. He was playing
fair. There was not even suggestion of a game of love, of love at
all. Platonic love, then? It was almost as if the suggestion had
been shouted at him; he could even perceive the ring of sarcastic
intonation, the incredulous sneer with which the world usually
accompanies the phrase. It made him angry. Why that stupid sneer?
Why, after all, should not platonic love be possible? To swine no, of
course not. But he did not expect to be a swine, was not one, in fact.
If the majority, the ruck of humanity, were too gross to conceive of
the possibility, the worse for them. That was none of his affair. He
could be, he was capable of intimate association with a beautiful woman
unblemished by thought, suggestion, even hint of sex.</p>

<p>The idea came to please him. It seemed capable of placing at an end the
indefinite suggestiveness of his thoughts, reduced the whole matter
to a concrete basis, the definitiveness of something recognized as
an existing phenomenon. His mind became easier. Might flash before
him a glimpse of what Karsten, for instance, would say should he have
divined his conclusion. He saw in his mind's eye the friendly irony of
his indulgent smile. Karsten was not unimaginative, just the contrary:
still he had dulled fineness of perception by over-indulgence in
affairs of love. History<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> had examples of it, Dante and Beatrice, and
Petrarch and Laura, and&mdash;&mdash; For the moment he could think of no others.
Instantly the imp. "Damned rare, eh!" He snapped his fingers. What was
the difference; the rarer, the more precious.</p>

<p>So he drifted on, more happily, more at peace with himself; felt that
he might safely, without feeling of guilt or apprehension, continue in
this delightful relation; need not studiously, conscientiously confine
himself to enjoying only the mind, the sympathy of thought with this
woman, but might allow himself, continently, to find pleasure in the
play of light on her hair, in letting his eye rest with satisfied
appreciation on the curve of her cheek, the contour of her svelte
figure. Life was being good to him. Even if an inspiration of a moment
might pounce upon him when least expected, "What if there had been no
Isabel?" He had gotten himself in hand now; his course was set, he had
but to steer watchfully, carefully, but, after all, safely.</p>

<p>And then, just as he had contrived to reduce his problem to safe and
definite tangibility, the whole thing dissipated, shattered abruptly
into a baffling void as does a glorious, iridescent bubble shimmering
brilliantly in the sunlight suddenly vanish into utter nothingness
without Visible cause or agency. She became elusive. The accustomed
places saw her no more. On rare occasions he might run across her, but
the circumstances were almost inauspicious,&mdash;a meeting on the Ginza,
at the Imperial, always with a background of entirely inconsequential
persons irritatingly intruding their irritating presence. Even when
he might manage to attain an occasional moment alone with her,
nothing was gained. She was not cold, not even formal, but without
appearing to wish to avoid him, she contrived to do so. There were
always reasons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> each one manifestly valid, why she could not accept
this or that invitation. There were no more rambles together, no
more dances. He marveled at the skill with which she maintained the
appearance of continuance of the old friendliness and yet erected,
with deft sureness, an invisible barrier. He felt like a fly dashing
itself against a clear pane of glass, hopelessly frustrated by the
unsurmountable opposition of the invisible. What the devil could be
the matter? He racked his brain, trying to seek a cause, to recall
whatever incident, some error of omission or commission, careless or
clumsy phrase, but always with the same result. He could think of
nothing; there was nothing. And she was manifestly not capricious, not
a flirt endeavoring to season more highly a man-woman relationship by
the spurious artifices of coquetry. It was disquieting, irritating,
maddening. What a damnable capacity for torment was possessed by
even the best of women! Was that one of the traits of the eternal
feminine, an unescapable remnant of the Old Eve, just as all men must
have in them some trace of the Old Adam? Probably the phenomenon was
nothing very intricate or perplexing to men who knew women, who had
experience in diagnosing such symptoms. He had never envied Karsten;
had rather been inclined to pity him as one who had dulled his
capacity for enjoyment of the best things in female companionship by
over-indulgence; still, for the purposes of this occasion, at least, he
wished that he possessed his facility with women, whatever advantages
his experience might give him for grappling with such problems.</p>

<p>Then, Karsten came to his aid unexpectedly. They were smoking after
dinner. Nothing much was being said. Karsten was wandering up and down
the floor, chewing the stem of his pipe. Suddenly he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> blurted out,
apropos of nothing whatever, pipe-stem waving in the direction of Kent:</p>

<p>"I say, Kent, mind you, I am not trying to intrude on your affairs,
but, I just wonder, have you ever mentioned to Miss Elliott anything
about your wife, anything about your being married?"</p>

<p>"What? What's that?" He was gaping at him surprised, fish-like. "I say,
old man, what in the devil are you driving at, anyway?"</p>

<p>He had been thinking of Sylvia just then, forcing his mind to
travel wearily over the same old ground, trying to discover some
tangible foothold from which to gain his way out from the baffling
intangibility, the vagueness of it all. Karsten's question was right
in line with his thoughts, fitted in as a marvelously apposite thing,
as if he had been trying to work out a fretwork puzzle and Karsten
had, by some surprising intuition, dumped before him one of the pieces
for which he had been looking to effect the solution. He shook himself
together. It seemed as if he must know something, have some idea,
anyway, some kind of factor which might aid in puzzling it all out.</p>

<p>He repeated, "And what are you driving at, anyway?" Absurdly, he felt
his chest contracting, the pulses in his temples swelling. He had no
business to be so excited.</p>

<p>"Well, I was wondering. I came across the fag end of a bit of gossip
to-day at the Imperial. Old Mrs. Tinker, the chief lady cat, you know,
called me over to her table, at tea. She doesn't usually so favor me,
you know. She's had enough to say about my foibles, what she could
find out and what she could imagine. But she simply couldn't contain
herself. She had just gotten hold of something that was too good to
keep, that she must get off her chest to some one, any one, I fancy,
and then I was your friend. I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> have been just like a find. Maybe
the old lady has some kind of rudimentary, perverted sense of the
dramatic&mdash;or she may have hoped to get something more in the way of
detail out of me. Anyway, she was full with it right up to the neck.
She couldn't even show a bit of finesse. She just blurted it at me. She
knew, of course, that you were a great friend of mine, and of Sylvia
Elliott's, and that you were a man of honor, a gentleman. She took
pains to repeat that, several times. But she wondered, she said, 'You
know I'm an old woman,' she said, and God knows, she spoke the truth
for once in her life. She wondered, the dear old soul, whether you had
realized that with a young, innocent girl like Sylvia&mdash;And then it came
again, like a refrain; she kept saying it, she must have said it a
dozen times, 'I am an old woman, you know,' but she wondered, the foul
old beast, whether you could really perceive the seriousness of it,
the woeful consequences of toying with the affections of an 'innocent
girl.' You know how such an old woman can say it so it becomes almost
an insult. Good God, even the worst of us have a pride in taking the
innocence of such a girl for granted, but such an old cat can contrive
to use the term with the most insidious innuendo. Why the devil do our
absurd rules of conduct prevent one from kicking an old beast like
that. I felt like doing it more than I've ever done it with respect to
any man. But there I must stand, deferentially, with a teacup waving in
my hand, with a show of courtesy, while she meandered on. You know, it
strikes me that such an absolutely useless old woman, an encumbrance on
earth, with no apparent purpose than that of making it a worse place to
live in for all the rest of us, can, while employing apparently all the
ordinary polite phraseology of courteous intercourse, produce more of
an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>effect of the most vicious foulness than can the most common harlot
or the roughest obscenity of a salt-water second mate. By the gods, it
seems to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and when you get through cussing old lady Tinker, I'd be
obliged to know what the deuce it was all about." Generally Kent
enjoyed Karsten's vivid circumambience, but now it seemed to him
almost irritatingly studied, as if the other were playing him, like
a fish. "Get on with your tale." He felt that the elusive thing, the
explanation which he had been ransacking heaven and earth for, was at
last within hand's reach.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, I beg your pardon. Well, the long and the short of it
was that the old girl had been informed that you had not told&mdash;that you
had taken pains not to tell, was the way she put it, with that sickly,
kindly, leering smile which she affects&mdash;that you were married. Oh,
yes, she had just heard of it. And I was a friend of yours, and didn't
I think that we older people&mdash;the smile again&mdash;just like that, she and
I in the same category, hand in hand&mdash;I'd given a thousand yen for the
privilege of heaving my tea in her face, hot tea&mdash;but would it not be
best if you were spoken to about it, given a hint, though&mdash;you could
see the satisfaction she got from spitting forth the full load of venom
she had been gathering from the start&mdash;she was happy to know that Miss
Elliott had been informed, fully informed, from a reliable source, most
reliable, in fact, from the very source from which she, herself, had
her information.</p>

<p>"And then she let me go. It must have seemed a good day's work to her,
letting loose that bit of trouble on the world. I can imagine her
sitting at home now, with her cat, or her parrot or whatever she has
got, and turning that bit of mischief over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> in her mind, cocking her
head on one side and scheming how she may elaborate on it, add a few
details, artistic touches, and where she may carry her tale to-morrow
where it may have the most effect. And, by the way, I wondered at the
time who her source of information might be, and it struck me&mdash;she had
just been sitting with that red-headed Wilson girl from the American
Auto Company, the two of them with their heads together thick as
thieves&mdash;I was wondering whether she might not be the serpent. Do you
know her?"</p>

<p>So that was it. For the moment Kent was confused by a clash of
conglomerate emotions; relief that, petty as the whole thing was, he at
least knew now the exact state of affairs, had gained a foothold whence
he might find his way out of the wilderness of uncertainty&mdash;and then,
on the other hand, the abominable, spiteful malignity of that girl,
that Wilson individual. Flashed into his mind the incident at the dance
on board the <i>Tenyo Maru</i>, and his intuitive premonition that from
the incidentally aroused enmity of this woman would come eventually a
venomous sting of malice.</p>

<p>Oh, the damned&mdash;&mdash;cat. He felt that he had never so absolutely
detested, utterly contemned a woman. "Yes, I know her. I chanced&mdash;she
was such a wantonly malicious beast&mdash;to offend her on the <i>Tenyo</i>.
Karsten, for what inscrutable reason does Providence create such women
and allow them to cumber the earth?"</p>

<p>"And why not?" The other shrugged his shoulders. "The question
arises with all kinds of women. Have you not at times, when you have
fortuitously chanced on some woman, some seductive beauty who by the
mere contact of a moment, glance of an eye, soft murmur of a few words,
smashes down <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>whatever defenses you may have laboriously contrived
against being enveloped in the net of the charm of women&mdash;and then,
when quietude of mind, the state of being tranquil, at peace, normal,
is, against your will, in spite of all you may do, abruptly shattered,
and when you feel yourself again racked in the nervous tension of
desire, passion, love, whatever you may call it&mdash;have you not then,
Kent, found yourself asking God whatever can be His intention in
letting loose upon earth women like that whose sole purpose seems to
be to steal away from men what little chance they may have of being
at peace? And as it is with that kind, I suppose it is with the
others, the plain women, envious, malicious, mischief-making. What
can be the purpose of their existence, unless it is to counterbalance
those others, to add the other ingredient with which it has pleased
Providence to contrive this madhouse of conflicting elements of
humanity which make up this world."</p>

<p>But Kent was paying no attention. What the deuce could he do? He felt
that now, when he had through fortuitous good fortune obtained the
solution of the riddle, his problem should have been almost solved;
but, incongruously, he seemed to have made no headway whatever. Now,
what should he do? His brain seemed to be void, to be incapable
of functioning. The feeling that Karsten was watching him, was
expecting him to pursue the subject, to carry on with it, made him
feel uncomfortable, irritated him, as if Karsten had been insistently
curious.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the Cabinet intends to do about the Russian policy
question." The remark escaped him almost involuntarily. He might as
well, he felt, have suggested a query as to what the weather was likely
to be the day after to-morrow, anything, however irrelevant. The fierce
pudicity which causes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> man to shrink from having bared before the
eyes of another man the intimate processes of his affections, made him
wish, desperately, to steer Karsten to some other subject. He repeated
it nervously, and even as he was speaking he felt the futility thereof.
"Now, I wonder what the Cabinet will do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what will the Cabinet do?" Karsten was leaning back in his chair,
regarding him ironically. "Oh, hell!" He turned and went over to fill
his pipe.</p>

<p>And, now he had driven Karsten away from the subject, it came to Kent
that that was just what he did not want to do. His own brain was as
inert as mud. Suddenly he was overcome with need for advice, sympathy,
with the desire to discuss the thing, talk it over, to get a helping
hand to swing his mind over the dead-center where it was now hanging.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what to do." He blurted it out. Even that&mdash;to get the
thing articulated, to place it in form of words&mdash;seemed to make an
advance, to make it more concrete. "Now, what can I do to set myself
right with Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"You love her?" Rather than a question, it seemed like the seeking of
definite confirmation, for the purpose of establishing a postulate for
further logical treatment of the problem. Of course, that wouldn't do.
The uneasy sense of evasion, of making the very beginning with what&mdash;he
could not evade it&mdash;was not essentially true, irritated him. He snapped
back, "No, of course, not." The harsh abruptness of his tone grated
in his own ears. That was no way to talk to a man who was, after all,
offering sympathy, a friend. He hastened to smooth it over.</p>

<p>"I like her. I am extremely fond of her. I think more of her than of
any other woman, except&mdash;&mdash;" He had been about to say "my wife," but
he caught himself, disgusted at the facility with which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> almost
slid into smug hypocrisy. "I am fond of her, I say; I place every
possible value on her friendship, yes, platonic friendship, if you
please." He glared at Karsten, ready for fierce rejoinder, anticipating
ironic drawing of the mouth, incredulous gesture.</p>

<p>But Karsten let it pass. "And what have you yourself thought of doing?"</p>

<p>"But, hang it, man, that's just it. What the devil can I do? If she
were a sweetheart of mine, if there had been any sort of a love
relation, or even the possibility of the establishment of one, the
potentiality existing when a man who is free, marriageable, has been
on terms of fairly intimate friendship with a woman, then I might
reasonably go to her and make some kind of explanation. But now, what
can I do? I can't go up to her and say, 'Here, my dear, I am sorry if
I've overlooked telling you that I'm married. I'm sorry if I've caused
you to have futile expectations'&mdash;or just go up to her and remark,
quite casually, 'Oh, by the way, you know I have a wife.' I fancy that
if I had the wit, the experience that you have, for instance, I might
manage to contrive some subtle means, something to set this thing
straight, for, honestly&mdash;you'll have to take my word for it&mdash;what I
have said about the whole thing being just friendship is absolutely and
literally true."</p>

<p>"Just like with a man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just like with a man."</p>

<p>"Then, that's the answer. Treat the affair just as if she were a man.
If gossip had placed you in a false position with a man, you would go
to him, wouldn't you, and have a straight talk with him? Why can't you
give a woman, a woman whom you think so much of, credit for having
as much broadmindedness, intelligence, as a man? You hint about my
experience with women, about subtleties. Listen, if you will take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>advice from the depths of my ignorance, I will tell you one thing&mdash;and
it is something that I was stupid enough not to discover for years&mdash;the
sort of thing that is so obvious that you pass right over it without
seeing it&mdash;which is that with women, at least the right sort of women,
the best course, the only sensible course, is to tell them the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth. To some men, those who think
that in dealing with women one requires some specially intricate means,
that would seem the very culmination of subtlety, but it is, I am
earnestly convinced, the one and only way."</p>

<p>Yes, it sounded easy. He ruminated, turned the suggestion over and
over. The theory seemed all right, but when he came to translate it
into action, when he came to think of how he would approach her,
how he would open the subject, what he would say, it became utterly
impractical, impossible.</p>

<p>Karsten read his mind. "Yes, I know that it is easy to give advice
in such matters and quite another thing to carry out the suggestion.
But the only thing for you to do is to keep turning the thing over in
your mind, familiarize yourself with the idea. Then, gradually, as the
strangeness thereof wears away, when it no longer stuns your brain
with the impact of something astounding, precipitate, you will find it
becoming more rational to you. Eventually you may find that working out
the thing becomes fairly natural, even relatively easy. What is there
about it that sticks you, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Blessed if I know; no one particular point, the whole thing more or
less. I know how I myself have always been able to see just what the
other chap should do, how it has irritated me often to see some fellow
pursue an absolutely foolish course with respect to some woman, doing
exactly what he shouldn't do, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>purblind to the absolutely obvious. I
have felt like taking him by the shoulder and saying, 'Here, Tom, Dick,
or Bill, or whoever you may be, can't you see, you fool, that what this
particular girl wants is this, that, or the other. It is like watching
a chess game. The onlooker sees the approaching mate much sooner than
the man who is playing the game. And in this kind of a thing another
can't possibly see into, or appreciate just what is going on in the
other chap's mind; estimate the infinitely fine manifestations, the
super-delicate emotional vibrations so imperceptible that the man
himself can only barely feel them without being able to analyze them.
And, for one thing, I think just one of the flaws in your theory is
that the premises are not altogether well taken. You say, 'If the
relation is just like that of man with man, then treat it like that.'
And in a way it is; but then again, in another way it isn't. It can't
be. With a man the idea of sex relation is necessarily absent, but with
a woman, even when neither has it in mind at all, it cannot be avoided
altogether, ignored. Take this case. I'm sure that I never thought of
it. In fact, I'm sure that she never thought of it either. The very
circumstance that quite likely I never did mention my wife, that I've
not the slightest recollection whether I ever did so or not, shows,
doesn't it, that my mind was entirely free from the idea. So, with a
man, there would be no problem at all; but with a woman, with Sylvia,
no matter how delicately I approach the matter, the suggestion must
come into evidence that one fears, one thinks, that she must, to some
extent at least, have had in mind the fact that she is a woman and I
a man. It is virtually as if one said, 'Here, I'm afraid that you may
not be quite clear that this is purely a friendly relation, that sex
doesn't enter into it.' Damn it, I can't express the thought without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>getting it into phrases that are blunt, clumsy; but you get the idea,
don't you? I'm hanged if I can see how I could do it without becoming
positively insulting.</p>

<p>"And then there's another thing, something that really hurts me more
than any other phase of it all, and that is, Why should a girl like
Sylvia, clean, sweet-minded, sensible, be affected by a thing like
that? It is almost as if she, in fact, did suspect me of having really
had in the back of my mind all the time some such insidious intention.
And still, I am absolutely sure that she cannot have. By the gods,
Karsten, the ways of women are something absolutely inscrutable to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's simple enough. It takes no mysterious knowledge of sex to
explain that. Use your common sense, man. I'll admit that that struck
me also, for a moment, and I was a bit disappointed in her; but, if
you reason for a moment, it is plain enough. It's not that, not with
Sylvia. It is nothing to her whether you mentioned your wife or not,
whether you have a wife or not. She's not the kind of a girl who looks
upon every male who is fortuitously thrown in her way as a potential
husband, whose entire scheme of existence is bound up in the idea of
ensnaring a provider. And I'm sure that she cannot believe that you had
any philandering in mind. Trust a woman for that, especially one so
delicately constituted as Sylvia. And even the most stupid ones, any
woman, since it is part of the very essence of being a woman, knows
instinctively, by intuition, when the sex element, however subtly,
is hovering about. No, what has affected Sylvia, the reason why she
keeps you at arm's length, is the manner in which the thing has been
presented to her. Can't you imagine the insidious, slimy suggestiveness
of that Wilson individual, coming to her with her, 'You really ought
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> know, my dear'; how noisome the mere idea must have been to her
that any one, the Wilson thing, all the rest of the gossips, were
turning this thing over and over on their salacious tongues, this
innocent, patently clean relation existing between her and you. It must
have been immeasurably offensive to her, intolerable. Put yourself
in her place for a moment. Probably she may have been as reluctant
as you are to give up this pleasant friendship. But what could she
do? Being a woman, hedged in by the myriad conventions which tie up a
woman's freedom of action much more than they do a man's, she'd find
herself in an even more difficult position than that which you are in
and which puzzles you so. No, old man, that's all plain enough; and if
you find that you can't bring yourself to take the bull by the horns
and talk it out with her, why, the only thing you can do is to let the
thing rest for the time being. Neither seek her nor evade her. Don't
increase her difficulties by asking her to go about with you; to a
girl so essentially honest and honorable it must be extremely annoying
to be forced to resort to the small lies, the petty prevarications
of convention, to invent excuses&mdash;but don't evade her either. Be as
courteous, friendly and frank as ever, and, above all, be natural. As
time passes the gossips will find other victims and eventually you can,
if you are careful, tactful, drift back into the old relation. Yes,
it's rotten, isn't it, that in this world such damnable machinations as
breaking up a clean, beautiful relation as that between you and Sylvia
can be possible, and that it can be carried out triumphantly, in the
name of purity, of virtue. By the gods, I think at times that if the
prudes were less busy, the world might be a much cleaner place to live
in."</p>

<p>Karsten was right. Kent felt an intense gratitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> to him for having
dispelled thus surely, by the incontrovertible logic of plain sense,
the rankling doubt that had assailed him, strive as he might against
it, about Sylvia. It placed the whole situation in a much better light.
Sylvia was all right. The essence of the relation between them had not
been vitiated. All this was but the disturbing echo of something from
outside, annoying, distressing, but in the end surely ineffectual. So
he would follow Karsten's advice. Everything would come out all right.</p>

<p class="space-above">She had brought to the window the tall bamboo cage, had opened the tiny
gate of intricately interwoven strips. All about her stood trunks and
boxes. From the back came the clatter of the carters carrying stuff out
to the cart. She had waited with this to the very last. Now she stood
back, watching the lark as it hopped about on the bottom of the cage,
eyeing curiously the opened door. She had often been disturbed by the
thought that she should not keep this bird a prisoner; but she had been
assured that it had been born in captivity, that it would prefer the
comfortable life, protected behind the slender bamboo bars. Now, it
seemed as if it really did. It was in no hurry to grasp at freedom.</p>

<p>The bird hopped up into the opening and sat, cocking its head, as if in
doubt, peering into the world before it. Now, what would it do; would
it really be happier in the protection of confinement, or would it have
the courage to grasp the freedom of unknown distances?</p>

<p>Unknown distances! She felt that she herself was uneasily uncertain,
tremulous at the idea of setting behind her the small world into which
she had fitted herself so agreeably. She was cowardly, like the bird,
then, not venturesome enough to face the unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> No, it was not
that. She must be frank with herself; her cowardice lay in not daring
to remain; and, moreover, she was not acting honestly to Kent. The
suggestion of the Wilson creature, the mere effrontery of her making
such an insinuation, had dumbfounded her. Of course, she had known
always&mdash;so long as she had known him; on board the <i>Tenyo</i>&mdash;that he
was married. She could not even remember whether he had told her, had
ever mentioned it, or whether she had come to know from an extraneous
source, ship's gossip. It had been a matter of no moment whatever,
utterly inconsequential. And to him it must have been inconsequential
too; a thing which had no bearing whatever on their relation. The
effrontery of this woman, and of the others, all those who, she
had said, were now whispering among themselves about them. She had
smiled at her assurance that she had known, that it was a matter of
no consequence one way or the other, the incredulous smile, updrawn
brows, that was an insult in itself. And then the hard shamelessness
with which she had tried to pursue the matter, to gain more pabulum
for gossip; endeavoring to establish a pretense of intimacy which
was entirely inexistent, she had hoped, she said, meretriciously
solicitous, that she did not really love him, that this would not
hurt her. Sylvia might have taken her by the hair, dragged her forth,
thrown her out, her fierce desire for primitive methods of combat, to
rend this foully insulting female into tatters, had surprised her. The
intense repression, the nervous bewildered casting about for escape,
had left her trembling, white.</p>

<p>And when she had finally gotten rid of the woman somehow, and had sat
down to compose herself to think, she had been confused, bewildered,
unable to seize upon some starting point from which to develop a line
of thought. Instinctively she wanted to hide, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> shelter herself in
some place where all this foulness could not reach her, to escape. It
had always been her intention to wander on beyond Japan, to grapple
with new landscapes, new colors, feathery palm fronds swaying beneath
the stars, the iridescent brilliance of the tropics. She had already
long overstayed the time she had originally decided to devote to Japan.
She had found so much more material than she had expected, and&mdash;yes,
of course, if she were to think this thing out, she must be entirely
honest, probe into herself with the dissecting knife no matter how she
might shrink&mdash;yes, the truth was that she had not wished to abandon
her friendship with Kent. Yes, friendship. It had been just that, only
that. That, at least, she might say with absolute truth. True, there
had been moments where the thought had come to her that if he had been
free, their relation might have been enhanced, vivified by the rosy
light of romance. She had even&mdash;she was going to have this thing out
with herself, go to the very most intimate essence thereof&mdash;yes, there
had been a time when she had wondered what was really the relation
between Kent and his wife; was there not a possibility that freedom
might come to him? But she had put the thought behind her, ashamed,
disgusted with herself that she could thus be tempted to contemplate
gaining a love which was the rightful property of another, insidiously
coveting affection which belonged rightfully to that other woman. So,
even though it was evident that the day might come when the barrier
might be removed, she had refused to consider the possibility, as an
unworthy thought. The line between considering the potentiality and
wishing that it might be brought about was too fine. And now that she
had gotten past all that, and their relation had crystallized safely on
a firmly constructed foundation, she was forced to leave it all. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
was it not cowardly thus to concede victory to the mischief makers, to
desert Kent? Would it not be cleaner, more worthy to remain, stick it
out. She wished she were strong enough to stay, to continue, defiantly,
the relation, safe in her knowledge that not the slightest suspicion of
a thought of sex entered into the minds of Kent and herself. And still,
there was no escape from the certainty that the thought could not be
ignored; the gossips had injected it. She must always wonder whether
Kent had heard what they thought. He must wonder whether she had. They
had soiled their friendship with the foulness of their insinuating
suggestion. No matter how she and Kent might try to erase it from their
minds, some faint trace, some ineradicable smudge must remain.</p>

<p>The bird was hopping about on the window sill, lifting its wings in
little tentative flaps, restless, fluttering in indecision. She stepped
up to it. Why didn't the silly little thing have the initiative to
make the break into freedom, to grasp the alluring promises of the
new, unknown beyond. She watched it. "Oh, we are poor things, you and
I. But, out you go." With her hand she pushed it gently out. It had to
use its wings to save itself. It fluttered; then it stretched them out,
strongly, boldly, circled slowly, then more surely, gained upwards,
rose higher and higher, disappeared in the blue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>Divorce!</p>

<p>Kent read the letter over again, carefully, laboriously, for his
thoughts would not concentrate on the sentences. He had to force
himself to bring his mind on them. The letters from Isabel had shown
indifference, every evidence of having been written as a matter of
duty in their painstaking regularity, one a month; they had been cold
even; but he had never for a moment suspected that she would, suddenly,
without leaving room for discussion, thus make the end bluntly, finally.</p>

<p>She wrote that the petition had been filed in court. The grounds were
desertion. The summons would probably be in the same mail. Desertion.
It struck him as wantonly malicious treachery. He had been careful
always to send her the regular allowance which they had agreed upon
before he left for Japan, and even more. He could certainly show in
court&mdash;&mdash; Still, what was the use? He would not contest the case. If
she wanted divorce, well, let her have it. A man was a fool who would
try to hold a woman against her desire. And then, after all, why should
he care? His affection for her had long since dissipated. The adage
that absence makes the heart grow fonder&mdash;he had more than halfway
believed that it might work out&mdash;but it had not in his case, nor,
evidently, in hers either. He had no cause to object. On the contrary,
she was giving him his freedom. It was the logical thing, after all.</p>

<p>Now, if that had come a year ago, before Sylvia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> had left Tokyo? Isabel
must even then have considered divorce. She had probably done so even
before he left America. Why could she not have done it then, when he
and Sylvia&mdash;&mdash; Would she have married him? Plainly, she had liked him,
but this other? Still, there would have been a chance. And now, now
when opportunity had finally come, it was so absurdly futile. He had no
means of reaching Sylvia. She had disappeared utterly, had gone as if
she had vanished into space. No one appeared to know where she might
be. Evidently she had wished to disassociate herself entirely from
Tokyo, to sever every thread that might connect her with Japan. He had
written a couple of times on chance clews. She had been seen by some
one somewhere along the upper Yangtze. A note in the personal column
of a Hongkong paper showed that she had gone from that place to Macao.
Report had it that she had visited Singapore. He had written each time,
but nothing had ever come of it. So he had given up thought of her,
forced himself to blot that chapter out of his life, to consider it a
definitely closed incident. Now, it was too late. Even if he knew where
to find her, what would she say should he gallop up to her the moment
he was free. One could never know how a woman might take things. And
then she would by this time undoubtedly have found new friends, might
be engaged, married, for all he might know. No, even if he might find
her, should she have been placed out of his reach through some other
man, that, he knew, must hurt him like the devil. It would reopen,
grievously lacerate the old wound which seemed now to have all but
healed. After all, he had come to appreciate, enjoy in recent months
his safety from emotional turmoil. One risked too much, paid too
heavily for the raptures of infatuation. He would remain safe. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>So that phase of the situation was disposed of. He would allow himself
to consider it no more. Now for the other phases.</p>

<p>He lit his pipe and leaned back to think it over, to reason it out.
Logically he should be pleased; but he could not make himself feel so.
It was an ugly word, "desertion"; smacked of being a scoundrel. Still,
of course, divorces were common things, and every one knew that the
law required, for some obscure reason, that the grounds must always be
clothed in terms implying disgrace of some kind. Well, let it go.</p>

<p>Still, he was oddly dissatisfied. He tried to analyze his feelings.
Gradually, as he smoked, it came to him that what he resented was the
suddenness of entire change in his status of life, the necessity for
making new adjustments. He would now be alone, under a changed moral
code, a different mode of life. Still, he was being made free. What
he lost was, of course, only obligations. To blazes with the entire
business!</p>

<p>He crumpled the letter and threw it out of the window impulsively.
He would be rid of the whole thing, like that; would write her to go
ahead. It was the end. Undoubtedly he would soon find himself pleased,
as he should be, that a relation had been severed which there could be
no possible reason to continue.</p>

<p>"Kent-san."</p>

<p>It was a woman's voice, low, clear. He looked about, startled out
of his thoughts. There she was, across the alley, in her window,
his geisha neighbor. Through the bamboo bars she was holding out
to him something white. He recognized the crumpled letter. What
a perverse grotesquery of fate that his divorce announcement
should, eccentrically, cause his acquaintance with this woman, this
professional in the arts of affection, whom he had heretofore known
only mutely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> through her formal courtesy of a smile when she had
happened to meet his eye from her window.</p>

<p>"It came right in through the window. It frightened me. It hit me right
on the head." She was laughing, but her eyes asked for explanation. Of
course&mdash;one did not throw things through windows, even at geisha.</p>

<p>"Pardon me. I was angry. It was bad news. My wife in America is seeking
divorce." He caught himself. It was stupid to plump it out to an utter
stranger; but the idea had filled his mind, had dominated him so
entirely that the words had slipped without thinking.</p>

<p>"<i>O kinodoku sama</i>, I am so sorry." The smiling face became a mask of
polite regret. "Do you love her?"</p>

<p>The amazing frankness of the Orient in intimately personal matters in
contrast to its reticence where the West is frank!</p>

<p>"No, I don't care a bit." As he spoke he felt with surprised
satisfaction that he really did not care, that his resentment was
fading. Evidently it did him good to get this thing out of his system,
to speak out about it, even to this new-found geisha friend. It was
not so incongruous, after all. Was she not supposed to be an expert in
matters of the heart.</p>

<p>Her serious expression vanished instantly. She laughed. They did really
laugh like "tinkling silver bells," some of these Japanese girls. "Then
you will find another woman. Ah, but here in Japan, what will you do?
Here we have only the <i>kitanai</i> Japanese girls."</p>

<p>"<i>Kitanai</i>," literally "unclean," used in the sense of "unworthy" as
the Japanese always speaks, perfunctorily, of what is his own. The
unjustness of the phrase bewildered him for the moment, as he thought
for words to express indignant refutation, protest that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> the Japanese
girl was, of course, the very opposite of "<i>kitanai</i>."</p>

<p>He started to answer. The murmur of a voice came to him from the unseen
background of the girl's room. The face of an old woman appeared behind
her.</p>

<p>"I was just calling at the shaved-ice man," said the girl, over her
shoulder. "But he didn't hear me. He has gone." Evidently the elder
woman, probably a sort of duenna, had asked her what she was doing. He
admired her instant wit. She smiled at him hurriedly, surreptitiously.
He caught the odd charm of the wink of her long almond eye. Then the
<i>shoji</i> closed.</p>

<p>Well! A bizarre episode. But a charming one. He was in a happy frame of
mind. It was a good augury. Evidently he was not so badly hurt, when a
pretty face could so easily dispel his resentment. Divorce; it was only
proper that his marriage be ended, an unsatisfactory chapter. Let the
thing take its course.</p>

<p>He decided to place the letter in a drawer where he kept things
which he wished to remain unseen by the unknown one who periodically
ransacked his desk. He had left it open purposely, and at the top he
had placed a layer of old papers, which must have been seen often by
the intruder, and which could no longer tempt his curiosity. Below the
papers he kept the other things, his wife's letters mainly, and then
Kimiko-san's slippers. He had been surprised to receive them in the
mail, a few days after their first dance in Tsurumi. It had amused him
that she had taken him thus literally. It was dangerous to be jocose
with Japanese girls; they were likely to take things to the letter. But
he had been pleased at the possession, at having this dainty, unique
souvenir of a delightful incident of his life in Japan.</p>

<p>He was surprised to find that the investigator had evidently been
there. The ruse had not worked. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> slippers were not in the position
where he had left them. Still, it made little difference. He would take
them home. The trophy would amuse Jun-san.</p>

<p>Jun-san was intensely interested, pleaded that he tell her from whom he
had obtained them. He always enjoyed seeing her in her gay moods; she
was generally so serious, almost melancholy. He had planned to bring
about this air of gayety, that he might, as had been the case when he
was chatting with his geisha neighbor, forget unpleasant thoughts.
But it failed. The humor dissipated. The serious thoughts recurred
insistently. He could see that Karsten noticed his preoccupation. The
idea came to him to tell Karsten all about it, talk it out with him.
It would do him good; one always reasoned more clearly when one placed
one's thoughts in words to another; and then Karsten had been known in
San Francisco as a man with unusual experience with women, had had the
reputation of being an expert, in those days, in such matters.</p>

<p>So after dinner, when they were sitting upstairs, as usual, looking
over the blaze of the geisha quarter below, he told him. "It is not so
much that I care," he concluded. "There was no longer such a thing as
affection&mdash;on either side. But I can't help feeling a vague sense of
trouble, of unrest. I am fairly commonplace. I don't give much thought
to self-analysis and that sort of thing. I was married; it was a state
of affairs, a condition. I had become used to it. It governed my
relations to women. I followed the traditional moral code of marriage,
gave no thought to such matters. It was plain sailing; I played the
game with my wife; there could be no other women; it was an easy frame
of mind. And now it seems as if suddenly I am at sea without sailing
orders, as if I were captain of a ship in mid-ocean and suddenly find
that I have no compass course, no destination. And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> of course, one
must have one, must decide where one is going. You would say that it
makes no difference, that as I have not seen my wife for a year or
more, the thing is essentially the same. But it isn't. I am bewildered
by a feeling that my status is utterly different, cataclysmically
changed. I am like a life prisoner who has without warning been taken
out of a cell where he has lain for years, passively, without need
of thought of what he should do with life, and who is then suddenly
placed in the midst of the sunlit city. He feels he is free, must do
something, wants to do something, but somehow, oddly, misses the quiet
impassivity, the lack of responsibility of his cell. I know that there
is no reason why I shouldn't live to-morrow as I did yesterday, but the
fact is that for some reason it seems impossible. There is the sense of
an entirely new condition of life which overwhelms me, and I want to, I
feel I must respond to it, in some way, but&mdash;I know I talk like a fool.
I am hanged if I can explain coherently&mdash;but I wish I knew what I want
to do."</p>

<p>"I think you are doing the best thing just now," said Karsten. "Talk it
out of your system. After all, it is a thing you will eventually decide
for yourself, gradually. You need be in no hurry. I know just how you
feel. You know I was divorced, too. Only in my case another woman, whom
I cared for, threw me over at the same time. I went through the same
thing. I don't pretend to be able to give advice. In such matters a man
must act on his own. But, since we have come to the intimate things in
our lives, I don't mind telling you how I fared. One may profit from
the foolishness of others."</p>

<p>He smoked silently for a while, evidently gathering his thoughts. "My
marriage turned out just like yours," he began suddenly. "There was
no reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> why it shouldn't have turned out well, only it didn't.
We simply grew tired of each other, for the usual reason, too much
intimate daily contact. When one sees every day, morning after morning,
a woman in a dressing gown, with her hair down, going through the
process of elaborating her attractions, careless of one's presence,
it takes the glamor out of the illusion. A man shaving, seen every
morning, can hardly be an inspiring spectacle. Crudely put, that was
about all there was to it. Came the divorce. It was the only reasonable
thing. I felt that I should be pleased, but, just like you, I felt
bewildered, that I had lost my bearings.</p>

<p>"I drifted for a while, but I was agitated, nervous, febrile; felt that
I should have done with women, but the very fact that I had my liberty,
that I could do as I pleased, kept running in my mind. It gave me no
rest. I had no moral scruples. You know I am a Dane. The family is one
of these old tradition-ridden clans that you find in Europe. Everything
must be governed by precedent set by people who have been dead for
ages. In my tribe the woman element has always been predominant. When
I was still in school my uncles impressed on me the family code&mdash;never
touch a friend's wife or his daughter, and never cause a woman regret.
Simple, isn't it? If such things worked, it would probably be as good,
at least for those whom it fitted, as any other, but such things are
not nostrums.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I felt then that as long as I lived up to that, I was all
right. Then Sanford, of the <i>San Francisco Herald</i>, you know, gave me a
piece of advice. He quoted Lawrence Hope's verse recommending to 'love
only lightly,' to pluck the pleasant, superficial flowers of love and
to avoid the thorns by not allowing yourself to become too devoted to
any one woman. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> took the advice too seriously. You remember that
during my last years in San Francisco I was just a roué, a libertine,
a swine. Instead of giving me rest, peace of mind, I became worse off
than ever. Then accident brought me to Japan. It did me good. What had
bothered me was, I discovered, not lust for women, but only desire
for excitement; but, of course, as you know, in our well-ordered
civilization a man can get excitement, change, new impressions and
experiences out of few things, politics, sports, gambling, business
perhaps, but, if he is cursed with an imagination, mainly women. When
I came here, all the new life, the new sights, interested me so much
that after awhile I found myself rational again. I played a bit with
the geisha, down there, but temperately, sensibly. Then, finally,
accident brought me a woman, a Japanese woman, for whom I felt real
affection, whom I really cared for. I found that I wanted no others. I
was absolutely faithful to her, not because I had to be, nor because I
felt that I ought to be, but because I wanted to be. That is where the
relation without benefit of clergy works better than the institution
of marriage. It is more likely to last because of the absence of the
feeling that one must be faithful as a matter of obligation. I had come
to the conclusion that monogamy is the only rational, natural thing,
one man for one woman, one woman for one man. I would like to see some
kind of marriage invented that would work effectively. In my case, I
was happier than I had ever been. I had peace, content, I thought I had
solved my life.&mdash;Then my&mdash;my best friend seduced the woman."</p>

<p>As he talked, Karsten had been pacing up and down the narrow veranda
which, now the <i>shoji</i> had been removed on account of the heat, formed
part of the room. Now he stopped and stood staring out over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> the city,
smoking silently. Suddenly he turned, faced Kent.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that there has not been as much as I thought in all this
for you to draw a moral from. I'll be more specific. What I was trying
to drive at was this: why don't you, in a tentative way, try the 'love
lightly.' That I made a mess of it, at first, in San Francisco, was my
own fault. One may take an overdose of any remedy. But here in Japan it
is somewhat different. First of all, there is no sense in deliberately
going out stalking such adventure. The kind you find that way, picking
up with the first woman who crosses your path, doesn't pan out. But
keep your mind open, ready to seize upon opportunity&mdash;it will come. In
fact, I have rather wondered that you have not come to it, in spite of
your principle, though, by the way, I rather admire the fact that you
have stuck to it. But I have been watching you&mdash;one can't help watching
a man whom one likes when living together as we do&mdash;and I think that
it is with you as with Kipling's Tomlinson&mdash;if you will forgive the
paraphrase&mdash;that 'the roots of sin are there.' You take too much
interest in the life, and color, and movement that you see all about
you. The unique charm of these Japanese women has gotten its insidious
white fingers on you. That principle of yours was all that held you
back, wasn't it? Now that's gone&mdash;<i>le deluge</i>! No, maybe not quite
that, but I expect to see you soon studying Japanese life and character
by the only means through which it can be studied with something
resembling complete understanding&mdash;through some woman. As a matter of
fact, there is no reason why you shouldn't, and there is every reason
why you should. It is your business as a newspaperman to get inside
the Japanese mind as intimately as you can. You know that it cannot
be done through the men; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> bar of nationality, race, is constantly
between you and perfect frankness. But with women sex is bigger than
race. When a woman cares for you, she looks upon you as a man, not as
an alien. She gives you her heart, her innermost mind, without thought
of nationality. You understand me, don't you. I don't mean that you
should deliberately, cold-bloodedly stalk a woman for the purpose of
dissecting her soul and using the results for calculated, mercenary
purposes, just to reduce them to copy. What I mean is that you are now
free to follow when inclination in the form of a woman beckons you;
only be careful that you go into it only as a game, and let the woman
understand that it is only a game. At least part of the old family
code is good&mdash;that to the effect that one must not cause a woman to
suffer. So be careful how you play. You have heard, as I have heard a
thousand times, that these women are cold, passionless. It is a lie. I
know it. Their capacity for affection, devotion, sacrifice, is as great
as that of our women; sometimes I think it is even greater. And their
poor little souls are delicate, sensitive. They are like children, who
brood over and magnify sorrows which we might consider fairly trivial.
And then they have their heads still filled with feudal romance. They
read their paper-covered novels seeking with noble sacrifice for love
and all that, <i>shinju</i>, double suicide, you know, where the lovers kill
themselves together. We had a case last year right here in the quarter
below, where a geisha and a student threw themselves into the Kegon
waterfall, at Nikko, which is the most fashionable thing. One reads
of cases where friends who get wind of the intention of the lovers
insist on joining the party, and then there is a triple suicide. They
get their heads filled with this kind of romance, picture themselves
as heroes and heroines in the high lights of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> melodrama, imagine how
the papers will sound their names from one end of Japan to the other.
It may be a bit hard for the practical American mind to understand,
but the Japanese have an odd, introspective, often a bit hysterical
psychology, something like the Russians, I often think, like characters
out of Dostoievsky.</p>

<p>"So, to sum it all up, I think it will be a good thing for you to leave
the latchstring of your heart hanging out a bit that some little hand
may take a pull at it by chance. It will be good for your present state
of mind, and it will be good for your work. I am not joking. Not only
will it give you insight into Japanese character such as you may get
in no other way, but, if you are at all like me, you may find in some
girl, if not exactly inspiration, whatever that is, at least some kind
of subtle sympathy that helps and pushes you along. I myself, in my
time, under just such circumstances, did some mighty good work, or came
near accomplishing it, but now, damn it!"</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers, flung out in impatient gesture. The pause was
so sudden it produced, conflictingly, the effect of an abrupt sound, a
trumpet blare in hushed stillness. Kent looked up. Jun-san had noticed
it, too. Squatting on her silk <i>zabuton</i> in the background, her sewing
had dropped to her lap, and she was looking at Karsten wonderingly,
solicitously. She never spoke in English; it was generally accepted
that she did not understand it, but Kent wondered whether she did
not really understand more than they thought, whether she might not
intuitively, from intonation, gesture, aided by such words as she
must have picked up, gain at least some idea of the drift of their
conversation.</p>

<p>The silence became uncomfortable, exasperating. "But why don't you take
it up again? You are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> man to mope about. You are not doing anything,
just killing time reading magazines and novels. How can that satisfy
you in the long run. Why, then, don't you take some of the advice that
you have just given me?"</p>

<p>"I can't, or at least I won't, on account of&mdash;&mdash; That is, the woman
is still here, in Tokyo, and I want to show her. It may seem to you
contradictory, absurd, perverse. It doesn't sound logical, except,
possibly, as a sort of heaping of coals on her head, to show her that
I, at least, am faithful. I never told her what I knew, never blamed
her. I think that in this way she is getting punishment far more subtle
than anything I could inflict by abusing her, or by running after other
women. Something must be going on in her mind. Still, who am I that I
should have a right to punish any woman for turning to another man,
after my sort of life? I only got what I deserved, after all. Anyway,
my position happened to be such that I couldn't speak out, couldn't
jump on the man or the woman. That rather governed my course. For, of
course, one doesn't in that way, in such a case, when one is still
agitated, shattered by anger, jealousy, disappointment, in all that
whirl of emotions, just sit down and deliberately shape out a definite
course of procedure, I shall do this, and I shall do that. No, one
stews about, waits to figure it out, to decide what to do when one
has become calmer, and then, if one has done nothing at the moment of
crisis, at the impulse of sudden discovery, consternation, passion,
then one gradually drifts into accepting the course which things
naturally take, the path of least resistance. Yes, that's undoubtedly
it, the path of least resistance."</p>

<p>He shook out his pipe into a huge brass bowl which was kept in the
room for that purpose; took out his knife, began with over-careful
deliberation to carve out the lava-like incrustations from the bowl. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the work you were doing?" Kent wanted to bring the conversation
into a smoother channel. He was nervous, uncomfortable, with a sense
of something undefinably grievous, tragic, as if it were, hovering,
indefinitely threatening, closing about them from the darkness outside.</p>

<p>"The work!" Karsten kept scraping at the pipe bowl, methodically
held it to the light, inspected it. "It took the heart out of me,
this revelation, the sudden shock of it. It had been too perfect,
this working away, always in festival spirits, in the atmosphere of
affection, devotion, love, damn it, to use the banal old word. I
thought I had the rest of my life all well ordered, that peace had
come at last. I am too old to start again, and then, anyway, as I told
you, there were other reasons. So the work&mdash;I have never looked at it
since. But," he seemed struck by a sudden thought. "Jun-san," he was
still intent with his pipe and did not look up. "Jun-san. Bring out the
<i>kodomo</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Kodomo</i>," child. The word puzzled Kent. What the devil&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>He looked past Karsten, as he sat there doggedly scraping at his pipe,
to Jun-san. She had risen from her <i>zabuton</i>, was looking at the man
with wonder. It grew into consternation; was it apprehension, fear? But
she had turned and was going to the <i>todana</i>, wall closet, was drawing
from it papers, loose and in bundles, reaching into the depth of the
recess, pulling out still more. Then she turned and came towards them,
arms filled, held in front of her. She advanced hesitatingly. By God,
she was trembling; her eyes were misty with tears. Kent jumped up, but
she did not look at him. In front of Karsten she stopped, held her
burden towards him, silent, trembling. He laid away his pipe finally,
looked up at her, stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> out his hands. She moved still nearer, as
if to pass the papers over to him. Then her hands fell away, bundles
dropping, loose papers fluttering to the floor, into the brass bowl.
Karsten had risen, patted the woman on the shoulder tenderly, as one
would a child. It was the first time Kent had seen him caress her.
"Oh, you poor little girl, you poor little girl," the man's voice
was hoarse, broken. "Come, you had better go to your house." She was
weeping openly now, shaking. "Forgive me, Jun-san. Come."</p>

<p>The sliding door closed behind her. Karsten turned to Kent. "I might
as well tell you now, of course. The woman was Jun-san." He turned
abruptly to the papers, began gathering them. "These are nothing much,
after all, Kent. Only notes of various kinds for a great Japanese drama
that I thought I might construct. The Danes have a proverb that every
sow thinks that her own pigs are the best. Probably I did the same."
He carried the papers to the <i>todana</i>, put them out of sight. "We have
had a melodramatic evening, haven't we, Kent-san, with your troubles
and mine. It seems as if women must ever be the cause of our sorrows,
yes, and our joys. <i>Shikataganai.</i> It can't be helped. Now let us have
a drink and go to bed."</p>

<p>They had their drink. Karsten went to the adjoining room where he
slept. Kent started downstairs to his room. At the head of the
stairway he noticed something dark, bulky in the half-light, moving a
little; his ear caught a sharp indrawn breath. It was Jun-san. A wave
of intense pity swept over him. He wanted to say something to her,
to comfort her, but what could he say. Undoubtedly she wished to be
undisturbed by such crude, stupid consolation as he might contrive.
He descended slowly and went to bed. But he could not sleep. He lay
tossing, it seemed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> hours. What, after all, did love of women,
relations with women, ever bring but regret; swift, passionate,
heart-swelling joy for the moment, even for days or years, but in the
end weariness, sorrow, pangs of tragedy, irreparable, regretful remorse?</p>

<p>In the stillness of the night he could hear the shrill twitter of the
cicadas in the garden, and faintly, softly, the sobbing, interminable,
unconsolable, of Jun-san.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>It was a dull season for news. From San Francisco they had cabled
him to "hold down." A nation-wide strike in America and one of these
futile European reparations conferences were filling the papers at
home, leaving scant space for Oriental matters. Anyway, nothing was
happening. His idleness irked him. Everything seemed to have slipped
into a dull, wearisome routine. He rebelled at it&mdash;anything for a
bit of excitement of some kind, any kind. The thought came to him,
kept recurring insistently, that now was time to look about a little,
to experiment with Karsten's advice. After all, why not? Was he not
missing something, an interesting and pleasing phase of life in the
Orient, one that they all unanimously described as delectable, from
Pierre Loti on. Even the warning contained in the episode between
Karsten and Jun-san was losing its significance. At home matters had
slipped back into the old, daily routine, as if nothing had happened.
Through the day she was always in the main house, watching with
solicitous care to meet Karsten's wants, retiring only when he had
retired, to her own house, the bower which Karsten had had built for
her when their love was young. As he looked back at it, it seemed to
him that probably the whole thing had been just a little melodramatic;
they had been overwrought, excited. Karsten had always been
super-sensitive, too nervously susceptible to his own emotions; the
dramatic instinct, no doubt. And then Jun-san. Well, they were not all
like her. These international adventures were often, generally indeed,
colored by humor rather than by tragedy. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>He recalled the predicament, a few weeks ago, of Carruthers, who had
amused his group of friends with his agitated alarm at his grotesque
predicament. A geisha had unexpectedly, much to his pleased surprise,
sent a note to him. She had summoned him, and he had answered, quickly
enough, in a spirit of curiosity. Later it had developed that she
thought he looked like Douglas Fairbanks, her favorite motion-picture
hero. Prosaic Carruthers, solemnly horse-faced, the practical machinery
salesman from Pittsburgh&mdash;they had all been highly amused at the
absurdity. The later developments had given them still more and even
greater delight.</p>

<p>Carruthers had taken a house in one of the suburbs in preparation for
the arrival of his wife and drove of children. But he had thought
that he might as well make use of the opportunity, his last fling of
freedom. So he had invited her there, and she had come, and she had
stayed, and when the wife was due in but a few days, she had still
stayed, had refused to leave. Carruthers had been frantic. It had
delighted them. Five days more&mdash;and she held the fort. Three days only.
He had rushed from one to the other to help him out, give him advice,
take the girl away, steal her from him, anything. "For God's sake,
fellows, this is no joke. Take her off my hands, somebody." It had
tickled them. "But how, Carruthers? Be sensible. We don't look like
Douglas Fairbanks." It had been entrancingly amusing. Despairingly he
had given the details. "The day after to-morrow, and she won't get out.
I've told her my wife is coming, my <i>wife</i>. And she says she loves me.
She don't care. If my wife comes, she will stay as my <i>mekake</i>, my
concubine. Imagine me introducing: Mrs. Carruthers, my concubine&mdash;just
like that! No, by Cæsar, it's gone beyond a joke. You've got to help
me out." By Jove, it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> been a scream, till the very last. But on
the last day of grace they had rid him of the lady. It had not been so
easy, either. It had taken all the powers of the accomplished Nishimura
to move her. He was useful, as he claimed. And Carruthers had had to
pay her geisha license for a month. He looked upon it as a joke now;
rather enjoyed telling the story. And the girl, she had taken no hurt,
either. Nishimura said that she had spread the glad tidings all over
Shimbashi. There was only fun, amusement, in an episode like that,
at least if one were single, and then a little excitement. Life was
becoming unbearably humdrum.</p>

<p>He was gradually becoming better acquainted with his geisha neighbor.
Toshi-san she said her name was, and he was introduced to the duenna,
her "mother" she called her, and to her maid, and to her doll,
Mitsuko-san. In the morning, at about ten o'clock, when she opened the
<i>shoji</i> to look at the weather, they often chatted. She was a pretty,
vivacious little thing, wholly adorable, and they knew how to look
after themselves, these geisha. So why not?</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the afternoon, before she began her caterwauling samisen
practice, she would play for him a few phonograph pieces, "Rigoletto,"
the Dvo&#345;ák "Humoresque," the things which it seemed all Tokyo was
fond of. He did not understand much about music, still it seemed to
him a pity if this country, these people, who had until now acquired
fair taste through the fortunate absence of trashy, ephemeral rubbish,
should now fall victims to the various "Blues" and "Bells" of fox-trot
repertoires.</p>

<p>She evidently enjoyed the music; that was not pose. Her face beamed
when she would announce the acquisition of a new record. "I have got
'Ave Malia.' It goes like that." She tried a high note, amusingly
dissonant, in her typical geisha falsetto. "You should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> see my
phonograph. It is high, like that," she held her hand to the height of
her bosom.</p>

<p>It seemed a chance. "All right, let me see it. I'd like to. When?"</p>

<p>But she was horrified. No, certainly not. Of course, he could not come
to her house. The obstacle made him obstinate.</p>

<p>"All right, then. I'll go to the waiting-house over there and send for
you. Then you'll have to come, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, maybe; but if I come I'll bring my Mother." She pointed her
tongue at him, just an infinitesimal tip, pink between white teeth,
laughed, and was gone.</p>

<p>It seemed absurd. The girl was a geisha; it was her business to
entertain guests, dance and sing for them at least, even if she
apparently must reserve the favors of affection for that police
commissioner, whose presence one sensed, obscure in the background,
through the phonograph, the ever multiplying new records, new jewelry,
all evidently offerings from him.</p>

<p>"I don't quite get it all. Surely she doesn't drag that stage property
mother of hers about wherever she has guests. Can you explain?" he
asked Karsten.</p>

<p>"Well, first of all, of course, you can't visit a geisha in her own
house; at least, old man, it is not etiquette, it isn't done. You must
meet them in the waiting-houses. If they didn't the waiting-houses
would lose their commissions and would boycott the geisha. And the
geisha guild would cause trouble. It is with that as with everything
else in Japan, as in business where there must always be a half dozen
middlemen between producer and consumer. Of course, you might take her
on a picnic, if she consents, but I wouldn't, if I were you. Japan
is changing. We are getting away from the days of Loti. Be discreet,
anyway. And then it's expensive. You have to pay a tremendous fee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> even
for just the pleasure of helping her pick flowers, or sea shells, or
whatever it might be, and she will have you buy a cartload of souvenirs
for herself, and the mother, and the maid, and her friends, and the
cat, for all I know. Anyway, remember the police commissioner. She
would probably not dare."</p>

<p>So the matter did not progress. They chatted almost every day, across
the alley, but she smiled at his invitations, enjoyed teasing him. It
seemed an impasse.</p>

<p>He had stayed late at the Foreign Office, one afternoon, talking
with young Kikuchi. They decided to dine together, but Kikuchi had
an engagement and left early. Kent did not feel like going home. A
gorgeously brilliant full moon, supernaturally large, was rising
ponderously over the Shiba park trees. It brought out Tokyo to best
advantage. In the shimmering half-light the crude modernisms, the
telephone poles, wires, irritating newfangled architecture, receded
faded away, and one might let the eye see only typical Japan, the
opaquely lighted <i>shoji</i>, curved rooftrees. He had had a few cocktails,
felt titillating with effervescent life, adventurous under the glamor
of the moon, anticipatingly ready and eager for something out of the
ordinary, some adventure. It might lurk anywhere, inside <i>shoji</i>, in
dark gateways. He strolled through the geisha quarter, hoping that from
some miniature garden, glimpsed through ornate gate, might stretch
towards him white hands, might come some soft seductive voice. He
knew that it was utterly unlikely, that, did he desire adventure, he
must take the initiative. But he did not wish to do that. It would
spoil just that element of chance, casual hazard of fortune, that was
essential. He felt that somehow it was hovering close at hand, would
come to-night, out of the silver-blue. His vagrant, erratic mood, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
moon, the whispering mystery of coyly self-effacive Tokyo, gave him an
odd feeling as if the entire great city were a slily demure courtesan,
enigmatically but encouragingly smiling upon him.</p>

<p>But it seemed all to be a great, fantastic mockery. Desire, mood,
setting, romantic, inviting adventure, were all there, but as he
passed along, expectantly turning this corner, then the next, ever
anticipatory, hopeful that now it would come&mdash;nothing came. The alleys
were almost deserted. A geisha passed him, tripping along with evident
set destination, followed by her little maid clasping long-necked
silk-wrapped samisen, but she was answering the call of some one else,
some male waiting on the <i>zabuton</i> somewhere. Fate was concerned with
others, was busy elsewhere. His walk became disappointing, tedious. Now
he was near his office. He had run out of tobacco. He went upstairs.
It was the first time he had been there at night. His glance strayed
across to Toshi-san's window. It was dark. Where might she be;
entertaining some one, possibly that damned commissioner.</p>

<p>The moonlight was glorious. He remembered that Nishimura had said that
the flat roof of the house was a fine place for <i>tsuki-mi</i>, viewing the
moon, the favorite Japanese pastime which even the most prosaic seemed
to appreciate. Why not take a look; the night was still young. He
climbed up the narrow ladder-like staircase, pushed a sliding cover and
climbed out on the roof. Loose planks had been placed to form a crude
flooring. He squatted on them, and looked about, over the picturesque
tiled roofs, the small platforms built on them for clothes drying and,
more romantically, <i>tsuki-mi</i>.</p>

<p>On the platform just opposite something moved, took shape of a woman.
He bent forward to see more closely. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-evening, Kent-san. Do you like the moon view?"</p>

<p>It was Toshi-san, the adventure at last. He would not let it slip from
him. She was entrancing in the moonlight, ethereal as some fantastic
fairy-land picture. From where he sat the moon was almost directly
behind her. An inspiration came to him and he moved a little, bringing
the great, yellow orb directly in line behind her, so that her head was
silhouetted against it, high helmet-like coiffure standing out black,
sharply contoured, the glowing disk against her profile like a luminous
halo&mdash;a preposterous image, a geisha with a halo. Surely this was a
night of witchery!</p>

<p>The opportunity had come. He jumped to his feet, the loose boards
rattling under him. It gave him an idea; he picked up one of them and
placed it as a bridge over the space between the two platforms. She had
risen also, stood looking over to him, hands grasping the low railing.
What on earth was this mad foreigner about to do now?</p>

<p>He tested the plank with his foot. "O-Toshi-san. I am coming over to
you."</p>

<p>"You mustn't. <i>Abunai.</i> Take care." But as she spoke she held out her
hands towards him, to assist him, receive him. Romance at last. What
would his prosaic San Francisco friends say, could they see him here,
under the full moon, flitting about among the Tokyo housetops, into
the arms of this flower-like Japanese girl, just a few feet away. He
glanced down into the narrow chasm of the alley below, its darkness
riven here and there by shafts of light from the windows. They would
not know, these people down there, no one would know, of this secret
meeting, his and O-Toshi-san's. This was the thing he had sought,
unpremeditated, a casual stroke of good fortune, with the pleasant
sense of venturing into the unknown. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>It was easy. A step, and he had crossed, felt her arms about him
solicitously, as she anxiously sought to drag him to safety. She
indicated the <i>zabuton</i> on which she had been sitting, pale-green with
a great crimson flower design. "Please, sit down."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you must sit there. Ladies first; that's foreign style, you
know."</p>

<p>She laughed delightedly. "Oh, how funny. I had heard that foreigners
did like that to their women; but it is so queer, to have it happen to
me, to oneself. Still, you must sit there. You are an <i>o-kyaku-san</i>, a
guest, you know."</p>

<p>"<i>Chigaimasen.</i> It makes no difference." He forced her gently down
on the cushions. "Anyway, I am not just a <i>kyaku-san</i>, just like the
others down there. I have come to you out of the night, dropped from
the moon."</p>

<p>She laughed again, that same clear silver tone; he sensed a musical
enjoyment from it. "It is just like a cinema picture, isn't it, your
coming to me, like that. I am glad it happened to me; you are so
adventurous, you foreigners, so different. I know how you do, from the
cinema, but I always wanted to know for myself. Yes, I am glad you are
not just a guest."</p>

<p>"<i>Naze?</i> Why?"</p>

<p>"<i>Naze-demo</i>," the equivalent to the white woman's "because." "I won't
tell you now; maybe some day, by-and-by," she smiled mischievously.
"Now tell me about your women. I see them on the Ginza sometimes, big,
strong, beautiful. Tell me, when you can have them, why do foreigners
sometimes love us little, <i>kitanai</i> Japanese girls?"</p>

<p>That absurd "<i>kitanai</i>" again! It was so inapposite, irritated him.
He hastened to explain, to refute, trying to seek the terms which he
thought might best appeal to this slight, fairy-like dream-picture,
whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> mode of thought, fashion of reasoning, was unknown, mysterious,
to him. He felt his way, amused at the intricate, curious task.</p>

<p>"You know, a mountain is beautiful, but so is a flower. You may find
your pleasure in the great, majestic beauty of Fuji-san, and then,
again," he seized her hand, "you may delight in the flower, in this
little hand, delicate, warm, soft," he smoothed the slender fingers,
"embodying in its delightful smallness the entire sum of infinite
perfection."</p>

<p>She let her hand lie in his. He drew her closer so her slim body
rested lightly against his, and as he did it he wondered, why she was
so passive, offering no resistance, not even making a show of doing
so? Was it because it was all in her day's work, an easy surrender to
careless handling, or mauling by clumsy, lustful paws of carousing
guests? It took the glamor out of the thing, stripped the situation
instantly of its air of light, ephemeral charm. How far did they go,
these girls; at least, how far did this one go? He would soon find out.
He threw both arms about her and drew her close into his clasp; but
now she resisted, set both hands against his face. He was surprised
at the strength of these slender arms. There could be no doubt of the
genuineness of her resistance. She fought desperately to get away. He
released her. She looked at him gravely, without anger, but just a bit
disdainfully. "But you mustn't do that, behave just like a rough guest.
I thought you were quiet. You must promise not to do that again. The
hand, yes, and, if you promise, I will sit quite near you, yes; but no
more."</p>

<p>He felt quite ashamed; still his curiosity had the better of him. Was
that the usual procedure, the favors usually granted the guests? He
asked her, bluntly. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no." She placed her hand on his arm, looked up at him seriously,
intently. "The hand, it doesn't matter. But I don't sit like that, so
close, with others. You, you were a friend."</p>

<p>She seemed so ingenuous, the air of innocence was quaint, irresistible.
He would have sworn that she told the truth&mdash;but what about the police
commissioner? He felt that it was churlish, an unworthy thing; still he
could not help asking: "But your police friend?"</p>

<p>She swept her hand outwards impatiently, as would she waft away
something noxious, unpleasant. "So you've heard. But what of it.
<i>Shikataganai</i>, it can't be helped. Why should you care; he has bought
me, he gives me many fine things; but he is only an <i>o-kyaku-san</i>,
after all&mdash;and you are a friend, so why should you care?"</p>

<p>She noted the surprise on his face, his amazement at this astonishing
reasoning. "But don't you understand, one doesn't care for the man who
is just a guest; it is a matter of business, but one doesn't love the
<i>o-kyaku-san</i>, no matter what he gives, money, presents. The man who
pays nothing, the friend, he's the one&mdash;the one whom one cares for.
But, of course, you are a foreigner; you may know the hearts of your
own women, but you don't know the hearts of geisha."</p>

<p>"No, how can I? Tell me. Teach me. Come over here again. I shall be
very quiet."</p>

<p>"Then promise." She held her hand out to him, the little finger curved
into a diminutive hook, took his hand and curved his finger in the same
fashion, linked it into her own. "That's the way we promise. Now, don't
forget."</p>

<p>She gave him her hand naïvely and snuggled close to him. "You have been
very rough, but I know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> you don't know about Japanese custom. So
now I shall tell you what to do to make the geisha like you. You know
when you act as you did just now, we don't like you. You must be kind,
gentle. We don't like rough men, or restless ones, and the ones who
laugh loudly at everything, or the ones who are over-sweet on first
acquaintance. And we don't like the ones who brag about themselves and
about their money, or who throw it about to show off, or the ones who
are too dandified, or who chatter too much. But we like the man who is
quiet, not too silent, but who talks pleasantly, and who doesn't boast,
and who doesn't brag about experience with geisha. If you want a geisha
to like you, don't be stingy, but don't spend over-much. Be cheerful
and be kind. That's why I like the foreigners in the cinema. And now I
have taught you a lot, and you are very wise, and," she laughed up into
his face, "next time you meet a geisha you know just how to win her."</p>

<p>He protested. He would use his knowledge only to win her; but she shook
her head. No, it was impossible. And now it was late. She must go. She
rose, bowed ceremoniously. He grasped her hand. Just a moment; would
she not meet him again? She could not tell; yes, she often came up here
for <i>tsuki-mi</i>. She bowed again and disappeared down the stairway into
the house.</p>

<p>After that he met her often, on the roof. As they became intimate, she
told him that she would come whenever she was not engaged; but she was
popular and he was often disappointed. It added to the fascination
of the meetings, the constant uncertainty, enhanced the pleasure of
being with her, listening to her grave, childish wisdom. He felt
that he might easily come to care for her, that she was insinuating
herself into his affection; that she might become the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> whom he
was awaiting to come from somewhere, into his life. But while their
friendship grew, and she talked more freely, confidently, and he felt
himself gaining an intimate insight into this quaint, delicate little
geisha soul, she maintained punctiliously the barrier of the first
evening. Carefully, with the most subtle caution, he endeavored to gain
a little more, to draw her closer, but she was ever alert, baffled him
quietly.</p>

<p>Usually their talk was gay, and especially when her intuition,
marvelously accurate, warned her of his restlessness, she held it so.
But one evening when the night was dark, with only a few faint stars
futilely scattered in the murk, he fancied that she was troubled. He
could not see her face, but as he sat near her he could notice her
bosom heave uneasily and sensed a trembling, nervous tension of her
body. But she would tell him nothing; said little, pressed close to
him, silently oppressed by her thoughts. What could be going on in
that childishly troubled little geisha mind, behind that clear white
forehead with its finely curved half-moon brows? He placed both arms
about her cautiously, but she did not resist. The poor, dear, little
girl! He wanted to hold her, help her, felt the instinct of protection,
affection. "O-Toshi-san, tell me what it is. I shall help you. Can't
you trust me a little, dearest? Can't you care for me a little?"</p>

<p>She straightened in his arms, drew her head back, black eyes gazing
deeply into his. Then, suddenly, she threw both arms about him, clung
to him convulsively, gaspingly, pressing her soft cheek against his. He
moved a little so he faced her. "Kiss me, O-Toshi-san." She drew back
her head a little, startled. "Kiss me, in the foreign way. You are a
foreigner's, now." He bent over to her, pressed his lips against her
soft mouth. But it was only a faint response. "I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> teach you to
kiss, dear. Come." Again he kissed her, again and again, and gradually
she responded, hot lips clung to his, as she trembled, clinging in his
arms.</p>

<p>"I left behind a flower yet in bud; it weighs on my mind that it may
blow without me."</p>

<p>A drunken guest was reeling from a waiting-house down the alley. She
drew herself away. "It is late. I must go." She raised herself on
her toes, framed his face between her hands, kissed him. "Good-by,
Kent-san. Good-by."</p>

<p>She was gone.</p>

<p>So it had come at last. The woman had come into his life. A geisha.
Now what would follow? What would be the arrangements? Could he take
her from the geisha house? Where? The thought of the <i>o-kyaku-san</i>
became suddenly intolerable. But just how should he proceed? Confound
his ignorance about such matters. He would ask Karsten for advice, but
first he wanted to see her again, to ask her what she wished to do.
Probably he would see her in her window, in the morning. Anyway, he did
not wish to reason, to fetter his thoughts with commonplace details.
That could be done later. His mind reverted to the events of the hours
just past, the amazingly unexpected good fortune, delight, which had
come to him like a shooting star out of the dark. He let the images of
recollection surge over him, envelop him. Thank God, life would have
some meaning, some of the high light of love venture to brighten the
dimness of dull routine existence.</p>

<p>He barely noticed, as he entered the office building the next morning,
a couple of hand-carts, piled high with boxes and bundles, moving
from the alley. He ran up the stairs, glanced through the window. The
<i>shoji</i> were open, but there was no sign of her. He seated himself at
his desk to wait, noticed an envelope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> a quaint flower-embossed thing,
and opened it curiously. The missive was from Toshi-san, written in
<i>kata-kana</i>, the easy phonetic script which she knew he understood.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div><i>Tame wo omoute</i></div>
<div><i>Hara tate sosete</i></div>
<div><i>Muri ni kayeshita</i></div>
<div><i>Atode naku.</i></div></div></div></div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Thinking only of his good,</div>
<div>I made him angry, sent him back</div>
<div>Against our mutual wish,</div>
<div>And then I wept.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Made him angry? What? The thought flashed on him, monstrously
appalling. He called Ishii. Had the people opposite moved? Yes, they
had left early that morning. Should he find out where? After a while he
came back. Yes, O-Toshi-san had gone away, no one would tell him where.</p>

<p>So the adventure had ended, suddenly, as it had begun. Why? What had
been her reason? Probably he would never know. The mysterious Orient,
yes, like an Arabian Nights tale, where the fairy vanished into vapor
at the profaning touch of importunate hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>Karsten could give him no help. "Better make up your mind that you
have lost her. She has evidently been taken away to some other
geisha quarter, Yotsuya, Ushigomo, Akasaka, probably Akasaka. They
must have smelt a rat, the geisha master, or the guild. They don't
want you to find her, and the police commissioner's being mixed
up in it complicates the affair, makes it harder. Anyway, you are
the gainer, you have had the experience. Now you know these girls'
insidious&mdash;charm. The word is threadbare, but it is the only one that
describes it. And then you have the memory.</p>

<p>"So make up your mind that she is gone. Presently there will be others;
and you will add to your collection of memories." He smiled. "I don't
know if it has ever struck you that as we plod along in life, with a
few bright spots, vivid pleasures, illuminating the general dullness of
existence, the only treasures really worth while that we gather are the
memories thereof. You know, as I grow older, I find that they become
valuable; they gain with age like wine. One picks them up and reviews
them, as one might old pressed flowers, faded ribbons, the stupid
material mementos. But the ones really worth while are those which
one has stored in one's mind; they don't fade, they never lose their
fragrance. And, do you know, I find that the ones which I treasure,
the ones that come back pleasurably into my thoughts again and again,
are not the recollections of such few good things, or wise things as I
have done&mdash;they seem drab, without color,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> or tone, or life. No, it's
the memories of the foolish things that I have done, madcap adventures,
turbulent love affairs,&mdash;these are the things that I find pleasure in
recalling. You have noticed those old fellows whose active life is
behind them, who sit in the sunshine and smoke, and think, and dream.
The daydreams of youth are all in future; but the old men have no
future. Their dreams are of the past. And it has occurred to me that I
know what they are dreaming of, as they sit there so quietly and smile
over their pipes, and it is not the clever things that they did, the
big deals they pulled off; no, it is the foolish pranks of youth, the
fiery, passionate adventures of young manhood,&mdash;these are the thoughts
which bring back youth to them, because they are characteristic of it,
as those others are not&mdash;these are what enable them to become young
again in their dreams, as they drowse, recalling this affair and that;
this tryst by a pool under a hot summer moon; this girl; that fight,
one after one, as one would tell off beads on a rosary.</p>

<p>"Even in my most frivolous days I used to have that idea, that however
foolish it all might seem, I was at least gaining memories for my old
age. Life becomes like diving after pearls in the opal, translucent
depths of the sea, which are strung one after the other; all may have a
general resemblance, color, luster, contour, but essentially each is a
little different from the others; each has its individual history. At
least, I have made that provision against my old age; I have a number
of memories to recall, to tell off on my rosary of experiences. Can
you think of anything so horrible as barren old age, the utter poverty
of the old man who has none of the recollections which may bring back
youth to him?" He laughed a little at his own earnestness. "'Tis a pet
theory of mine. You may think it a mad fancy, but possibly you may see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>something in it, and if you do, well&mdash;go forth and collect your pearls
while yet you may."</p>

<p>A bizarre idea; just like Karsten. But it carried no great appeal to
Kent. He had no heart to seek love deliberately, even lighter love must
come unsought. He would have enjoyed the company of some of the girls
whom he knew, but the Suzukis had gone to their villa in Oiso for the
summer, and he had not seen Kimiko-san since that night in the tea
house. She had joined a traveling theatrical company and was touring
the "colonies," Korea, Manchuria, Formosa.</p>

<p>He formed the habit of taking long walks in the evening, enjoying such
scant relief as one might obtain after the sweltering heat of the day.
These rambles took him all over the city and he found vague interest
in book stores, curio shops, odd little drinking places; in talking
with chance-met Japanese, clerks, barmaids, students, feeling that in
an indefinite, tentative way he might get a glimpse of the seething,
vaguely stirring thoughts of this multitude, gropingly, eagerly seeking
the ideas of the new, great world all around them, the uncertainly
fumbling mass mind in flux of transition.</p>

<p>He had dropped into one of the myriad small beer "halls," with their
pathetic attempts at modernity, which were springing up all over Tokyo.
They were generally much of a pattern, a few tables and chairs, foreign
style, cheap, slatternly maids making their attempt at new fashion by
means of dirty aprons tied over cotton kimonos. It was in Kanda, the
student quarter. Gangling youths, many of them bespectacled, in kimono
or university uniform, but nearly all with the brass-emblemed cap,
came and went, drank their beer, munched the food prepared in what was
supposed to be foreign fashion, joked with the waitresses. He noticed
that many went upstairs. Idly curious, he thought he would go up there,
but a waitress stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> him. He remonstrated; the others could go. No,
she was indefinite in her explanation, but determined. Well, no matter.
He dismissed it from his mind.</p>

<p>Suddenly some one stood before him, bowing deeply. It was Ishii, his
clerk.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Kent." He was evidently pleased to show the others
that he knew this foreign gentleman. Kent invited him to sit down. As
they chatted over their beer, he told him of his rebuff. What was the
reason?</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it is, in a way, a sort of a private place, kind of a
club." He was oddly evasive, ill at ease. "Just wait a moment, please."</p>

<p>He scrambled upstairs and disappeared. Presently he returned. "You can
come, if you like. They are my friends upstairs there. We meet here
sometimes. You know," he lowered his voice, "it's politics."</p>

<p>So that was it. Immediately Kent was eager to go. These were the
hotbeds of the new thought, the "dangerous thoughts," as the police
called them, half-baked Socialism, Communism, Sovietism, fortuitously
mixed with Cubist art, literature after the fashion of Dostoievsky,
crude passion for mass sculpture à la Rodin, anything that was thought
to be ultra-modern or outré, beyond the minds of the <i>hoi polloi</i>,
<i>haikara</i>, the latest in modern culture. It was an opportunity to learn
for himself what they really thought, these youths, how much of it was
real, and how much only pose; to see how deeply it all went, whether
it was merely the usual ebullience of youth, such as one might see in
the European universities, even in America, which usually spent itself
quite safely with passage into maturer years, or whether this was
really more definite, more likely to have direct, positive influence on
the life of the nation, the development of the government of Japan.</p>

<p>They were extremely courteous, quite friendly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> though a little
self-conscious, ill at ease, evidently diffident as to whether they
had been wise in admitting this stranger. He was invited to sit at the
table with two men older than the others; he was told that they were
professors. Scattered at other tables were some ten or twelve students,
much of a type, the ungainly age of adolescence. It was awkward in the
beginning. He had the uncomfortable feeling that they were taking his
measure, deciding whether he was quite safe. He would like to reassure
them; still, it was probably better to let the situation develop
spontaneously, to let them take the initiative. He drank with the two
professors; he judged them to be about thirty-five or forty, thin,
nervous men with the pale, somewhat ascetic faces of enthusiasts. They
opened with the questions usual in Japan; what was his nationality, how
long had he been in Japan?</p>

<p>"What are you politically?"</p>

<p>After that came a long conglomeration of political questions, first
tentative hints, designed to draw out his ideas, to determine his
stand, but soon they launched into their pet topic, the miseries of the
present situation in Japan.</p>

<p>"But surely you must see that, even if there are things to correct
in other countries, in no place are conditions so terrible as they
are in Japan." The elder professor had risen, swept out his hand,
addressing not only Kent but the whole assembly, the students who
sat gazing at him raptly. "There are only a few hundred thousands in
the privileged class. They are the ones who are gaining everything.
They took advantage of the fact that the people, the sixty millions,
are still thinking as they did in the days of the Tokugawa, looking
to their masters for orders, taking dumbly whatever they might deign
to fling to them. They have been exploiting the people, and they and
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> militarists want to exploit the other people, too, in Siberia
and China. You foreigners are always talking about the militarist
rule of Japan; but you don't see that even the militarists are not
all-powerful now. The real governing power of Japan is the little
multi-millionaire class, the Watanabes, the Fukusakis, the Oharas, the
Inouyes, the Yamanakas, the Katos, only about half a dozen enormously
wealthy houses, with their mines, and their steamship companies, their
tremendous business houses, their banks, who buy Diet members and
cabinet ministers, who determine the Government's policy, who keep
prices high by insisting on import tariffs, who wallow in concessions.
Even the militarists bow to them. The plutocrats wanted Siberia, so
we spent hundreds of millions of yen on the Siberia expedition and
our young men were killed by the thousands that the plutocrats might
get fisheries, and mines and oil wells. Japan to-day is a plutocratic
oligarchy, with the militarists as a handy and subservient tool, with
the police throwing into jail any one who tries to wake up the people
to assert their rights. Just look about you. See, right here in Tokyo,
the poor are huddled by thousands in hovels in Fukagawa and Honjo,
where the river washes out their houses every year, and still they must
pay heavy taxes on their miserable mud flats, while the rich with their
parks, stretching over vast spaces in the best and highest parts of the
city, pay taxes only on a valuation as forest lands or fields. These
are the ones who want the people to remain as they were a hundred years
ago, feudal slaves, in order that the rich may grow richer. That's
why the police keep watch over us and the government officials hire
<i>soshi</i>, professional ruffians, to break up our meetings. That's why
it is a crime to 'harbor dangerous thoughts.' Property is the curse of
all modern countries. When private property <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>became known the class
struggle began the world over; and nowhere is property as privileged as
it is in Japan. Labor should be the measure of value, undifferentiated
human labor, where all workers should be paid alike, no matter what
might be the manner of their work. Here capital exploits labor, as
capital always does, and only by abolition of capitalism can we abolish
such exploitation."</p>

<p>The professor flung back a long wisp of wet hair, paused to refresh
himself from his beer glass. The students were all nodding approval.
Evidently this was familiar doctrine to which they heartily subscribed.
Kent remembered the numberless volumes of Karl Marx which might be
seen in every second-hand book stall in the student quarter, along
Jimbo-cho. They swallowed it all, the Marxian dogmas, cramming them
down hastily in their hungry voracity for new thought, ever more.</p>

<p>Ishii-san insisted on seeing Kent part of the way home, after another
long harangue on capitalism, evidently a popular topic. As they left
the place, a shadow detached itself from the general blackness of the
buildings opposite and followed at a little distance. "A detective,"
whispered Ishii, excitedly. "He is following us. Oh, Mr. Kent, I wish I
might be arrested."</p>

<p>When they parted, Kent was relieved to see that the shadow followed
Ishii. He had no desire to become a victim to the burdensome attentions
of the police. Probably he had been foolish to venture into this queer
gathering. Still, it had been interesting, had given him another
glimpse into the intimate life of Japan, far more vitally important
than the phase which had heretofore intrigued him.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" he asked Kittrick a few days later. "It is up
to us to know all this that's going on all about us. It's widespread.
It's important.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> It has a vital bearing on the future of Japan, and
still it's so intangible, so oddly impossible to get at. Is it just an
intermittent phase, or is it a growing movement that will slowly but
surely result in fruit of some kind,&mdash;revolution or what?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I've been wanting to follow it, just as you have," said
Kittrick. "But what can one do? If you try to learn from the agitators,
no matter how innocent may be your intentions, the police will soon
make it impossible for you. One may get a little by following the
Japanese papers, watching the straws that show which way the wind
blows. Here you see a big appropriation for special officers to watch
over 'dangerous thoughts'; here's an item about a special force to
guard the persons of cabinet ministers.</p>

<p>"The point is that Japan is discarding her old beliefs, political,
social, ethical, religious, the whole business, and she is in
a breathless hurry to grab at anything, any kind of belief, or
philosophy, or political creed that comes handy. Of course it's a
mix-up. The political unrest may be dangerous in so far as it leads
excited fanatics to take too literally what they read or hear, so they
prize a knife or a bomb and sally forth to become heroes or martyrs,
but there is no great amount of sound sense or definite program in it.</p>

<p>"When the people stand up and shout for this thing or the other,
you'll find that the real underlying cause is entirely economic. A
few years ago Japan's industrial system was patriarchal. The boss had
a little shop with half a dozen or a dozen workmen. He fed them, and
clothed them and looked after them, <i>paterfamilias</i> fashion, did their
thinking for them, and they were quite satisfied. That was all they
knew. Now has come the big factory system, where thousands work in
great plants and never see the owner. The personal relation has been
lost. Then they've heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> that workmen in other countries have better
conditions. During the war, when workers must be had at any price to
fill the orders from abroad that swamped the factories, they learned to
strike for high pay&mdash;and got it. They've learned a lot of other things,
'sabotage,' 'go slow,' unionism, that labor may have a voice in factory
control, all that sort of thing. They see the rich grow richer, and are
learning that they ought to have a share of those profits. Most of them
think that Russia is a little paradise for the workmen. It's not the
political side that interests them, it's better conditions. They have
learned to look upon capitalism collectively and on labor collectively.
Their unions are becoming more and more consolidated. The next thing
you'll see nation-wide strikes.</p>

<p>"And in the meantime the economic situation grows worse every day.
Japan has lost her foreign markets, so she closes factories. The
capitalists insist on dividends, so, as they can't make money abroad,
they insist on keeping prices high on home products by keeping
production just a bit lower than the demand. That means closing more
factories, discharging more workmen, unemployment. If they kick too
much, they give them discharge allowances, six months' pay, a year's
pay, anything to avoid a row&mdash;and, of course, the consumer pays for
it, and prices go higher, while the workmen retire to the country
villages they came from and blow their allowances and then live on
their relatives. The family system of helping relatives is saving the
situation to-day. That's why you don't hear much trouble yet from
unemployment, but as the number increases of idlers whom each worker
must support, the condition grows worse. The end must come some day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>The situation grew on Kent's nerves. Every morning when he looked out
from his window, he half expected to see red flags in the streets, to
hear the turmoil of mobs. It was absurd, he told himself. There were
sure to be warnings, minor tumults, evidences of strained unrest.
Still, he felt that he must spare no time in getting inside the facts
as soon as possible, to come to see every side of the comprehensive
picture.</p>

<p>It would be a good idea to become acquainted with the capitalistic side
of the story. He began a round of calls on the money kings, captains of
industry, the owners of names which recurred constantly in the news of
economic events. For days he wandered about in the lairs of plutocracy,
sent his card in to dozens of men, wasted hours in bleak waiting
rooms with their scant furnishing of variegated chairs and tables,
dusty curtains and innumerable ash trays, smoked idly while hundreds
of clerks ran about, like bees in huge hives, or sat smoking and
drinking tea. But the great men were always out of the city, or sick,
or attending funerals of relatives. There was courtesy everywhere.
Would he not see such and such a secretary or third vice-president
instead? When he insisted, they shook their heads, a bit surprised at
the effrontery of this stranger who thought that he might thus easily
gain speech with the great ones. They were amusingly absurd, these
foreigners, seemed to be their thought. It was as if he had marched
into Buckingham Palace and demanded an interview with King George.
He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> knew that he could probably make his way into even these hallowed
sanctums, should he obtain letters of introduction from the Foreign
Office, which was always most obliging in such matters. He know that
letters of introduction held an exaggerated value, were regarded as
almost indispensable by the Japanese themselves. But they aroused his
resentment, these haughty, purse-proud plutocrats. Evidently talking to
the press was the last thing they desired. Well, let them go to blazes
then; if they did not want him to have their side of the story. He'd
get it elsewhere.</p>

<p>But Kent's peregrinations into the labyrinth of Japanese economics were
interrupted by a letter from Hopkinson, his editor, brought by hand
by a tourist friend who happened to pass through Japan. Kent was glad
to be certain that it had not passed through the uncertainties of the
Japanese post office or the more insidious danger of the ever prying
unseen hands.</p>

<p>"I want you to see what information you can get with respect to Japan's
submarine plans," wrote Hopkinson. "Of course, the old exaggerated
feeling of distrust against Japan in America has, since the Conference,
been replaced by a possibly just as exaggerated feeling of confidence
in her will to disarm. You will get what I am driving at by reading
the Bywater article which I enclose, particularly the part where he
says about Japan: 'With the possible exception of France, she is the
only signatory which has laid the keels of new cruisers, destroyers and
submarines since the limitation program was negotiated, and she is the
only one who is now at work on a large program of these vessels.&mdash;The
Japanese submarine flotilla is very much stronger both in numbers and
individual power than is generally known, and no other navy in the
world is building so many sea-going boats.&mdash;During the past three years
no coastal submarines have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> built in Japan, every boat being laid
down within that period having been designed for long-range cruising.'
Take this in connection with the speech of the Japanese War Minister,
which you recently sent us, in which he declares that 'if a nation has
large wealth, small standing armaments will suffice, for such a nation
will be able to expand fully its armaments in case of emergency. On
the contrary, a poor nation is necessarily compelled to develop its
armaments gradually, for it would be unable to expand them rapidly.'</p>

<p>"We don't want sensational stuff, as you know, for we intend to carry
on our policy of fostering friendship as long as possible, but we want
you to get as much dope as you can, if for nothing else, at least for
our own guidance and future reference&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Damn it! Just as he was getting well started with the economic matter,
he would have to devote his main energies to this distasteful task.
He liked the Japanese and took far more pleasure in his stories which
were to Japan's credit than in those which were not. However, there
was some satisfaction in knowing that the <i>Chronicle</i> would pursue its
usual conservative policy. As he thought the matter over, he became
more interested. Of course, the situation should be covered. Heretofore
he had followed it only in a general way, but had been inclined to
overlook its importance because of his interest in the economic and
social unrest.</p>

<p>"It's going to be the devil's own job," he said to Karsten, as they
were smoking their pipes after dinner. "If there's one thing the
Japanese keep quiet about, it's their submarines; and, of course,
nothing in the Conference agreement prevents them from building as many
as they like. And, besides, they are the obvious weapon of defense
against America. Japan has an ideal situation with a long barrier of
islands running from Saghalien as far as the Equator, if you include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the Mandate Islands. Yes, I know that under the Mandate terms, she
can't fortify them, but the Germans showed that any little place with
a few barrels of oil on it can make a submarine base. They can place
the oil there in a jiffy, if they expect trouble. Maybe it is already
there; oil can be used for lots of things besides war. There's nothing
to prevent it. With a chain of island supply stations and a great
fleet of submarines Japan can put up a wonderful defense and commerce
destruction. That's all self-evident. The job is going to be to find
out what they are doing in that line and what they intend to do. It's a
regular Oppenheim job. What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"You know I don't take much interest in that sort of thing," Karsten
rubbed his chin thoughtfully, stood up and began pacing the floor.
"Still, of course, one hears a lot of talk, and I think that most
foreigners here have about the same idea on the matter. The submarine
is Japan's natural weapon to-day. A few years ago, before America
entered the war, Japan thought she could lick the United States and her
strategy was based on offensive lines. When she found to her bitter
disappointment that America really could fight, she began to revise
her opinion, and when America's program of bigger fortifications in
Hawaii and elsewhere was brewing, she felt that she had no choice but
to continue feverishly with the Eight-and-Eight battle fleet program
which she had originated when the idea was to lick America. But she
could never have kept it up. She couldn't have afforded it. Of course,
the militarists are professionals who don't care about anything but
the army and navy. They would have insisted, even if the country had
been bled white. But even then, even if she had managed to build the
fleet, she couldn't have kept it up. Her war savings are decreasing at
an alarming rate, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> national wealth, commerce, industry, the whole
thing is decreasing. The Washington Conference was the biggest bit of
luck that ever happened to Japan. It enabled her to save her face, and
to make a big play to gain international confidence&mdash;which I'm glad she
got&mdash;and at the same time to save her from the necessity of building a
vast fleet of battleships, which she couldn't afford, and do it with
the assurance that America wouldn't outstrip her in a naval race either.</p>

<p>"So as Japan had, reluctantly, made up her mind that she must change
to a defensive strategy anyway, she is just as well off with a fleet
of submarines, which won't cost her nearly so much. Then, when I
said that the submarine was Japan's natural weapon, I meant it in a
psychological sense also. Remember, it has always been Japan's cue to
watch wars and take lessons from them. Nothing probably impressed her
quite so much as the fact that Germany almost beat England, in spite of
her great battleships, with her <i>unterseeboten</i>. The general horror of
the 'frightfulness' involved never touched Japan. She simply couldn't
see the idea. It was virtually successful&mdash;would have been entirely
so had Germany had the advantages that Japan has&mdash;and, personally, I
don't believe that the militarists have one ethic to rub on another,
so to speak. They'd cheerfully adopt German frightfulness, with such
improvements as they might devise, and never even be able to see that
it was morally wrong, so long as they thought that it would work and
that they could get away with it. You know that the German methods
never aroused the slightest feeling of disgust or horror in the
people of Japan. They honestly wondered what the devil we were making
such a fuss about. The militarists saw, sadly, that the German war
machine, which they had used as a model, went to smash, that they'd
have to remodel. There was never, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> whole people, any enmity
against Germany. At one time, during the spring of 1917 I think it
was, when some British ship had stopped a Japanese boat to search
for Germans, the feeling against England was far stronger than it
ever was against Germany. At the time of the Paris Conference, when
the rest of the world was yelling to hang the Kaiser, his picture,
mustaches, eagle helmet and all, was offered for sale in windows not a
block from Hibiya&mdash;though at reduced prices, it's fair to add. That's
why I say that the submarine is Japan's natural weapon. It suits her
geographically, financially and ethically. Go to it, old man, there's a
story there, all right&mdash;but I don't think you'll get it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>The more he thought it over, the more the new assignment appealed
to Kent. It required close thinking. He must move with the utmost
caution lest suspicion be aroused which would close up every source of
information instantly. He did not know just where to begin. He must
proceed very indirectly. The difficulty began to fascinate him.</p>

<p>Finally he made up his mind that he might as well begin with old
Viscount Kikuchi, the father of young Kikuchi of the Foreign Office,
member of the Privy Council, whom he had met through the son and whom
he called on occasionally. The name of the Viscount appeared only
seldom in the papers, but he was considered by those in the know to be
the most brilliant mind in the council, the best informed in respect
to international politics; some even insisted that he was the actual
director of Japan's foreign policy. Kent had a great liking for him,
a gentleman of the old school, who with his marvelously diversified
information with regard to the most intricate ramifications of politics
of Europe, America and Asia, wide reading in several languages, still
chose to preserve the manner and appearance, the admirable traditions
of vanishing Japan. His finely chiseled features and long, white beard
inspired a feeling of respect, almost reverence, lent him the aspect of
a Confucian sage of the old Chinese prints, heightened by the toga-like
simplicity of his black silk kimono, unornamented save for the <i>go
mon</i>, the family crest, a white circle with a conventional heraldic
device, white on the field of black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> on the back below the neck and on
the sleeves. He valued the Viscount highly as a source of information
and had often been pleasantly surprised at the frankness with which
he gave out facts which Kent had not thought it possible to gain,
disdaining the secrecy about petty matters so dear to the lesser minds
of Japanese officialdom.</p>

<p>Kent had not called for almost a month. It was quite natural to do
so now. The Viscount occupied a vast room on the third floor of an
office building near Hibiya, an odd rookery housing half a dozen of the
euphoniously named societies which have sprung up like mushrooms, in
Japan, and which serve no apparent purpose except that of furnishing
presidencies and vice-presidencies in legion to numerous honorable
gentlemen. As he climbed upward he passed the doors of the Society for
Inculcation of Spiritual Influences Among Workmen, the Foreign Policy
Debating Club, the Bolivian-Japanese Friendship Society, with their
drowsy office boys and idle secretaries smoking over <i>hibachi</i>,&mdash;a
queer collection of vapid purposelessness serving as a foil for the
activities of the busy brain up above.</p>

<p>But as Kent climbed up the stairway, he was thinking of the coming
interview, how he would lead off with the economic situation, stressing
the decline of Japan's finances and industries. Gradually he would
creep over to the taxation question, try to bring in the disappointing
lack of tax reduction in spite of the fact that armaments were being
reduced; possibly he might even venture to refer to Bywater, if it
seemed propitious and natural&mdash;it would depend on how things developed.
He would have to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if blotted out by a flash of blinding light, the whole
train of thoughts vanished, was obliterated completely. He found
himself staring at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> a face looking down at him from the landing
above that smote his senses, dumbfounded them with an overwhelming
realization of having been instantaneously, unexpectedly, brought face
to face with the essence of beauty, flawless, sublime, irradiating its
splendor towards him, as he advanced slowly, hesitatingly, upwards. In
the few moments which it took to mount the half dozen steps a whirl
of thoughts raced through his brain, each one clear-cut enough, like
the rapid succession of minute individual pictures of a cinema film,
yet all melting into one another, unifying into the one idea that here
was the marvel, a revelation&mdash;and yet it was not the instantaneous
flash of love, the <i>coup de foudre</i>, desire of fulfillment of desire,
possession; but rather the marvelous rapt wonder and delight at
magnificent, brilliant beauty, impersonal almost, as one may be struck
with ecstasy at the unexpected revealment of a splendid landscape
glimpsed suddenly through a rift in fog. In the half-light he was aware
mainly of the eyes, deep, dark, lustrously brilliant against her pale
face, framed by a cloud of black hair. It was as if he were advancing
into their luster, as if it suffused him.</p>

<p>As he stood in front of the table where she sat facing the stairs,
he felt breathless, confused at the necessity for drab, commonplace
action. He bowed ceremoniously, fished for his card case, conscious of
the wonder in her eyes, pleased at her smile, irritated with the sense
that he must be appearing like a fool, and still sensing delighted
gratification in the feeling of her presence.</p>

<p>Was the Viscount in? Yes. She took his card, flitted behind a screen
which separated her place from the main part of the great room. Yes,
the Viscount would see him. He noted the whiteness of her teeth as she
smiled. As he found a seat facing the Viscount,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> he discovered with joy
that he was able to look past the corner of the screen at the profile
of the girl as she sat at her post facing the stairway.</p>

<p>He tried to pull his thoughts together for the interview. Hang it,
it would be hard to think connectedly; the nicely arranged logic of
his questions had flown from him. He experienced intense relief when
he heard, as if from a distance, the words of the Viscount&mdash;he was
extremely sorry; he was glad to see him, but it happened that he had an
important engagement. He must leave in just a few minutes. Would not
Kent come again soon, at almost any time. He should be glad to give him
all the time he might wish.</p>

<p>What luck! Kent was glad at the heaven-sent granting of grace; he only
hated the necessity of leaving, of tearing himself away from this place
where he might sit and look at that girl, this revelation of beauty
which had come upon him by the wondrously kind offices of fate.</p>

<p>He shook hands with the Viscount. Safely behind the screen, as he
passed the girl, he bowed to her, with the ceremony as if she were a
great lady of the aristocracy, emphasized it, wishing to convey to
her, in some way, some indication of his desire to pay tribute to
that inexpressible perfection. As he made the turn of the stairway he
glanced back up at her. She was looking at him and smiled again. He
thought he detected a glint of something in her eyes, understanding,
gratification, something, anyway, which he might construe into the
slightest possible spark of a beginning of acquaintance.</p>

<p>He crossed through Hibiya Park and found a bench where he might sit
and get order into the confusion of his impressions. Love at first
sight? No, that was not it; there was no feeling of covetousness, of
passionate desire to win, conquer, possess; rather an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>overwhelming
longing to be in her presence, to sense that feeling of being
pleasurably suffused by the irradiation of pure, sheer beauty, as one
might bask in warm, brilliant sunshine. It was an odd, undefinable
sensation, defying logic or analysis. But why bother? He was wholly
overcome with the impression that great good fortune had come upon him.
He wanted to be near her, that was all. There was nothing to ponder
over except the means as to how he might contrive that.</p>

<p>Of course, he would have a chance to see her when he called on the
Viscount. He would call soon, to-morrow&mdash;no, that would be Friday, the
day for meeting of the Privy Council, and the Viscount would not be at
his office&mdash;would not be at his office&mdash;&mdash; In a flash the inspiration
came to him: why, that is just the time you must call, you fool; you'll
have a chance to see her, to talk to her alone, to gain a little
headway in acquaintance.</p>

<p>Through the day the thought kept recurring constantly, insistingly.
To-morrow. It interfered with other thoughts. Well, let them go. He
would think of her. But what did he want, anyway; what would it lead
to? He knew distinctly that he was not seeking a flirtation, a love
affair. She had not impressed him that way at all. Could one then not
be on terms of just friendship with a girl, enjoying her beauty as one
would that of a picture, a gorgeous temple, or a fine, rich brocade,
only that? Still, the idea kept clamoring, if they became friends,
intimate friends, would not, inevitably, time come when he would want
to hold her hand, gather her, the whole glorious sum of her beauty,
in his arms. He tried to push the thought away. That was not what he
wanted. It was the idea of the delicacy, the purity of relation which
fascinated him; to hold her tenderly, as one might a frail, fragile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
flower, a dainty, vivid butterfly, untouched, untainted by touch of
physical possession. Something, cynically suggestive, insisting in
crowding up from the depth of his mind, irritated him, like a mocking
face grinning at him insinuatingly. Hang it all! He must know her, that
was all there was to it. He would see her in the morning.</p>

<p>The following day, as he looked forward to the time when he might go to
her, new, disturbing thoughts kept cropping up. It seemed so foolish,
this suddenly being smitten by what had seemed to him an apparition
of perfection of beauty. Such could not appear, did not appear in
the persons of typists in Tokyo office buildings. The Japanese term
"<i>nido-bikuri</i>" shot into his mind, the laconically descriptive slang
phrase, literally "twice surprised," referring to the delighted wonder
of first sight of what appears to be perfection of beauty&mdash;the first
surprise&mdash;which is dissipated by the second closer sight thereof,
shattering the illusion&mdash;the second surprise. Probably he would find
that she was, after all, but a pretty little typist, dainty, attractive
and all that, but no more; that sober reality would cause this
iridescent bubble of fancy to dissolve instantaneously into its plain
component suds on which he might but stare in foolish disillusionment.</p>

<p>He made up his mind to banish from his mind all idea of romance, to
look upon her critically. If he had invested this girl with a glamor
of beauty created out of his own imagination, he would know it. He
tried to prepare himself for certain disappointment; of course, he had
been an ass. Still, as he climbed the stairs, his senses were aquiver
with an irrepressible anxiety,&mdash;what if she should be real, after all?
He peered eagerly up at her. Again the sense of beauty, the radiant
magnetism of it, swept over him; but he put it off, forced himself
to note that that dim half-light, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>which her black hair set against
the golden background of the great gilt screen behind her on which
refractions of light from beyond made a delicate shimmer and play of
faint aureate coruscations, might be limning a nimbus which would fade
away in the cold brightness of clear, white daylight.</p>

<p>Of course, he knew that she would tell him that Viscount Kikuchi was
absent. He had planned for all that. Too bad! Might he not have a
place for a moment where he might write him a note? She led him to
the great desk in the big room. Now would be his chance&mdash;but before
he could obtain a satisfactory look at her, she had disappeared. Hang
it! He began to write his note. He had it all in his head, merely a
polite word of regret, an assurance that his coming again so soon did
not indicate that what he had in mind was at all important. He would
call again. But he wrote slowly, hoping that she would come. Still
he did not hear her until she was close beside him, with a tray with
cigarettes and tea. She set it before him and stood facing him, a few
feet distant, courteously at his service. All this would give time. He
sipped slowly from the tiny, bowl-like cup, of the pale green, slightly
aromatic fluid, took a cigarette, lit it. With the feeling of one who
has placed a stake against the chance of a spun coin&mdash;he leaned back
and looked at her.</p>

<p>Thank God, she was pretty, yes, even beautiful, with that great crown
of soft black hair framing features delicately carved, finely-drawn
crescent eyebrows; slender figure, but with the slightest suggestion
of warm, soft curves under the closely clinging texture of the kimono.
But it was the eyes which held him. He had often felt the appeal of
the eyes of Japanese girls, with their appearance of intense blackness
until very close view revealed the dark-brown shade, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> this
girl's eyes was a depth, a liquid sheen of luminous, limpid blackness
which fascinated and held.</p>

<p>The feeling came to him that she was smiling. The mouth, features
remained calm, unchanged, but it was as if she could convey with these
marvelously expressive eyes alone mirth, amusement, probably also
sorrow, anger, anything.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have troubled you." He had to say something, even though
he should have liked just to sit there and fill his eyes with the sight
of her. "I hope I have not disturbed you&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"My name is Adachi." She had caught the question which he had meant to
imply.</p>

<p>"I have not seen you here before, Adachi-san."</p>

<p>"No, I have been here only a few weeks."</p>

<p>As he sipped his tea, he employed all his wit to maintain the
conversation, enjoying the clear, soft sound of her voice, its musical
contralto tone reminiscent of the subdued resonance of a great brass
temple bell from a distance. But he wanted principally to build up
ground for more intimate acquaintance, to become established as at
least some one just a little more personal than the ordinary caller.
She was smilingly responsive, gracious. He managed to remain a half
hour, with commonplaces. The weather led to talk of the countryside,
places she had seen, his own stay in Japan, and on to his impressions
of the country, to mutual tastes.</p>

<p>He came away with a pleasant feeling of success that he had not been
disappointed. Prosaic as their conversation had been, there had
been a subtle, warm undercurrent of understanding, mutual sympathy,
which was leading swiftly, surely, towards friendship. It was one of
Karsten's theories that the feeling of attraction between men and
women was intrinsically governed by an as yet little understood,
undefined element of something like telepathy&mdash;that such <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>attraction
as was produced by merely physical features, such as beauty, for
instance, was, if not unessential, at least only an outward, largely
crude feature of the play of the relation between sexes. It could
be explained most closely, said Karsten, in terms of physics, the
response which is established between instruments similarly attuned,
an intangible, invisible condition, which draws humans irresistibly,
apparently irrationally, together in one case, while in another, where
outward circumstances would seem to be more conducive thereto, they
remain untouched, cold. Of course, there was something in it. Kent felt
that some sort of sympathy like that existed between this girl and
himself. Oddly, he was certain that he was not in love with her, and
yet he craved intensely for intimate companionship with her.</p>

<p>A few days later he called again on the Viscount. He should have liked
to have arranged it again so he would see the girl alone; still, it
was time to get to work, to try somehow to establish a beginning point
whence he might evolve his information. The beginning of the interview
moved smoothly as he had planned, almost too smoothly. They arrived
at the crucial point, the Bywater article, so easily that Kent had an
uneasy sense that this smoothness, this facility, was deceptive, that
the Viscount by some trick of intuition knew what he was after and was
leading him on. The feeling disturbed him; he had to strive to overcome
a sense of diffidence, a suspicion that he was but being played with by
this uncannily clever diplomat, the master mind of the Japanese Empire,
who had for decades gained experience at this game in bouts with the
best trained brains of Europe and America.</p>

<p>"To come to the point, Mr. Kent, the fact is that it is believed, or
at least suspected, that Japan, while living up to the letter of the
Washington Conference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> agreement, is, in fact, violating the spirit
thereof; that while she is keeping her battle fleet strictly within
the ratio of six to America's and England's ten, as she agreed to do,
she is trying to make up for the difference in ratio by building up a
great fleet of powerful submarines. I am glad that we may take up this
matter together, for it is important that this misunderstanding be set
right. The fact is, as naval statistics which have already been made
public will show you, that we are merely trying to make our auxiliary
fleet forces catch up to the proper proportion they should bear to the
battle fleet. As you know, Japan is a poor country. In the past the
naval authorities decided to build a great fleet of vessels of the
first class, but to do so they had to give up building the number of
auxiliary craft which is generally considered by the naval experts of
all countries to be the minimum necessary to keep up the proportion
between battleships and auxiliaries. In other words, as we did not have
enough money to have both first-class ships and auxiliaries, we decided
to build the big ships, even though we knew that we should be short
of the smaller ones. Now that the Conference has made it unnecessary
to spend the great sums set aside for battleship construction, we are
using the chance to build smaller craft to the number necessary to make
proper proportion. That's the reason you hear that we are building some
submarines; but remember there's nothing sinister about that. We are
merely rounding out our construction program along the lines recognized
as being proper by all naval authorities. Of course, the mere fact
that we are building is being made use of by the anti-Japanese
propagandists, who seize anything whatever to make out a case against
Japan. It's partly because Japan's liberal diplomacy of recent years
had cut very short the crop of material that may be used as propaganda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
against us. We have always kept our word in both letter and spirit.
We gave the Chinese liberal terms in the Shantung settlement, and we
have withdrawn our troops from Shantung. We were liberal in respect to
Yap. We have withdrawn our troops from Siberia. We showed the world at
the Washington Conference that we have no militaristic ambitions. Our
action in all these cases has deprived the anti-Japanese propagandists
of their old weapons, so now they must invent stuff for calumny. All we
want is fair play. I know that you, Mr. Kent, are as interested as I
am in maintaining the friendly spirit now existing between America and
Japan; that you are glad to help combat the mischief-makers. Of course,
you know that I must never be quoted&mdash;but I give you my word that
there is not the slightest basis in fact for the belief that Japan is
violating either the letter or the spirit of the Washington agreement,
and the talk about her building an unduly large submarine fleet is pure
buncombe."</p>

<p>The Viscount spoke earnestly, with a tone which made for conviction
even though Kent had believed that he would talk on just about these
lines. He had been impressed, had leaned forward intent to follow
every word of the old statesman. Now he relaxed a little, leaned back
in his chair, let his eye wander. Suddenly he felt as if some one had
called sharply for his attention; involuntarily, mechanically, he
looked past the screen. She was peering intently into the room, frankly
eavesdropping, and her eyes were fixed on his as if she wished by mere
force of will to compel him to look at her. Apparently that was it,
for immediately the appearance of concentration vanished. She rose,
gathered some envelopes and descended the stairs noiselessly in her
soft <i>zori</i>.</p>

<p>There had been something indefinably impressive about these quite
ordinary actions. Of course, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> would probably ordinarily have
called from the hall below one of the innumerable office boys to mail
her letters. That she had chosen to go herself might have some slight
significance; but, even beyond that, the conviction came upon him as
clearly as if she had shouted it to him that she wished to speak to
him. Could it be that she really wanted to see him? The interview was
over. He must go, anyway. He would soon know.</p>

<p>He thanked the Viscount, feeling the while that, impressed as he had
been while under the direct sway of the old man's magnetism, the
interview would become cold, worth little, when examined in the somber
light of appraisement of its worth as copy. Had he been able to quote
Viscount Kikuchi, it might have had some value. But as it was, he had
gained nothing, not even the slightest clew. They shook hands and he
left.</p>

<p>Once on the street, he glanced eagerly up and down for the nearest
post-box. Yes, there she was, half hidden by the red, stunted column.
He went up to her eagerly. She made no pretense that she was not
waiting for him. As he came close, he could see that she was excited,
almost breathless.</p>

<p>He lifted his hat. "Adachi-san." But she was too eager to pay heed to
mere matters of courtesy. "Mr. Kent," for a moment he felt the pressure
of a small hand on his sleeve, "he lied to you."</p>

<p>He was struck utterly dumb, could but stare at her amazed. His first
reaction was one of disappointment. As he had hastened down to see her,
he had had no conscious thought of what he might expect. His whole mind
had been concentrated on the question as to whether he had really been
right in thinking that she wished to see him clandestinely, out of the
hearing of the Viscount. Now he realized that he must, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>subconsciously,
have expected something quite different, something in the lines of
furtherance of purely personal intimacy. And here she was evidently not
interested in him at all as an individual, but had some obscure purpose
connected with the political issue. He had to wrench his mind into
adjustment to this entirely new aspect of the matter, as he stood, hat
still in his hand, gaping at her.</p>

<p>"What? Lied about what? Do tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But her eagerness had disappeared, though the excitement remained as
her eyes flickered up and down the street. "No. I can't tell you,
not now. I must hurry back to the office. The Viscount will miss me.
Good-by."</p>

<p>She ran swiftly from him before he could even try to retain her.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged!"</p>

<p>Again he found the park a handy retreat where he might enter and
ruminate undisturbed over the tangle of events of the last half-hour,
the statement of the Viscount, the inexplicable mystery of this girl's
sudden injection of herself into the game as one of the players where
she should ordinarily have remained even less than a mere pawn; the
bearing that her taking a hand therein might have on the solution of
his problem.</p>

<p>As he reasoned it out, he decided that, as he had gained nothing from
the interview, he might, by some chance whim of fortune, have made a
still greater gain by the new element added by the girl's appearance
in the play. Apparently she knew something. She might know a great
deal. And evidently she wished to give him information, to put him
straight. Why? It was not because she took any great personal interest
in him; he was sure of that; her manner had shown no trace whatever of
the element of individual attraction. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> what her reason might be
was, after all, a secondary consideration; it was what she knew, what
she could tell him, evidently wished to tell him, that mattered. He
must follow up this chance-sent opportunity. Of course, he must see
her again. She must expect it. It might be worse. Here he had wished
to enter into some closer relation with her, friendship, intimate
association, and now the chance had come; although from an amazingly
unexpected angle. It even fitted right in with his work&mdash;but&mdash;as he
thought it over, the keenness of the feeling of good luck faded. It was
too romantic, melodramatic. He looked upon his work in the cold, keen
light of the professional, as a gatherer of facts, of news, prosaic,
practical, disdaining the blatant injection therein of the personal
element of the "trained seals." He might enjoy betimes coloring the
drabness of everyday existence by trying to apply tints of romance&mdash;he
had been rather inclined to do so lately; possibly it was the glamor
of newness of a strange land, or a reflection from his association
with Karsten,&mdash;but work and romance were inconsistent, conflicting. He
did not want to mix personal relation with this girl with business,
make use of her as a tool for prying into the secrets of Japanese
officialdom. Such use of women might be practical, it had undoubtedly
served in many cases, but it was distasteful to him, repellent. But,
on the other hand, what could he do? The girl herself wished it. He
was not stalking her, treacherously, with cold calculation, trying to
inveigle her into an affair of affections with the intention of making
her serve his purposes. It seemed rather as if she thought that, in
some undiscernible way, he might serve hers. He did not know what to
make of it. At one moment he would be pleased, exultant even, at this
element of intense interest injected into his existence, and the next
he would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> mystified, perplexed, impatient at his inability to see
the road before him.</p>

<p>Women! It seemed as if one must ever become entangled, somehow, in the
insinuating meshes of their ubiquitous activities.</p>


<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>For days he went about in a state of irritating uncertainty. What
should be his next step? There was no good reason for seeking further
speech with the Viscount for the present. Obviously the alternative
was to contrive to meet her on her way to or from the office, but this
method was distasteful to him, savored too much of lying in wait for
her, stalking her, as might a roué bent on philanderous enterprise. On
the other hand, his conscience troubled him. Here it was possible, even
likely that this girl might hold the key to his story, might give him
the starting point which he needed. He owed loyalty to his paper. He
felt that he was caught in a dilemma from which he might not extricate
himself entirely honorably.</p>

<p>One morning, at the Foreign Office, young Kikuchi dropped a chance
remark that his father had gone to Odawara for a few days. The idea
struck Kent that here lay the way out. Fate seemed deliberately to have
thrown the solution in his way, so he might see her without resorting
to slinking contrivances. He looked at his watch. It was half-past
eleven; this was Saturday and quite likely she would leave at noon. He
hurried to her office. She was evidently about to leave.</p>

<p>"I am sorry. The Viscount has gone to the country." He thought he
detected a hint of mischief in her eyes. Did she suspect him?</p>

<p>Would he have some tea? She came to his rescue before he had bethought
himself of the next step. What a blessing that eternal tea-drinking
ceremonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> could prove at times. Why, of course, he should like it
very much.</p>

<p>So again he found himself in one of the Viscount's great chairs, alone
with her. She brought the tray with tea and cigarettes. His success
made him bolder. "Have some with me, please do."</p>

<p>It startled her a little. "Why, of course not."</p>

<p>"Why not? It is the custom in foreign countries, and I am a foreigner.
Please?"</p>

<p>She smiled at his earnestness and gave in. Presently they were sipping
tea together. The scene assumed an air of intimacy. They chatted
pleasantly. The light silk shawl about her shoulders gave him a cue.
"You're about to go out, are you not. I really shouldn't keep you,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it's all right. It is Saturday, and I was thinking of going to the
pictures."</p>

<p>The pictures! So she was another of Japan's millions of movie
worshipers who form their ideas of Western civilization from the
frenzied life of the cinema, Wild West pictures of cowboys rescuing
lovely heroines from Indians and bandits, dainty damsels abducted
in madly racing automobiles, passionate love scenes in lavishly
upholstered abodes of plutocracy, gun-play and murder in city
streets&mdash;all the wildly gyrating, delirious melodrama which ingenuous
Japan seriously believes to be representative of life on the other side
of the ocean. The thought of the discomfort of most of the Tokyo movie
theaters, ramshackle fire-traps crowded with squirming, perspiring
humanity, stifling in the afternoon heat, repelled him; still, it would
not matter.</p>

<p>"I like the pictures very much too," he lied. "I wish you would let me
go with you."</p>

<p>But she shook her head determinedly. No, a foreigner and a Japanese
girl! It was too unusual. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"But are you then so old-fashioned?" He noted her quick frown. He had
gained a little. "Are you then one of these Japanese who, like the old
shoguns, want to hold Japan apart from the rest of civilization?" Now
he knew he had the right argument.</p>

<p>She flashed at him. "I am not old-fashioned." Her tone softened a
little. "But, of course, you know it is a little unusual for a Japanese
girl and a foreign man to go on the street together."</p>

<p>He sensed that he had won and made no further argument, only rose and
waited while she took away the tray. Together they went down the steps.</p>

<p>"And now where?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, Uyeno, of course, the art exhibition. I thought you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hastened to cut her short. "Yes, I know. But it is far. Let us have
tiffin first. Where? What do you prefer, Japanese or foreign food."</p>

<p>He knew she would prefer the rare experience of a foreign restaurant,
as Japanese girls almost invariably do. They went to one of the best
in Tokyo, a large, airy place thoroughly modern, a hot, wet towel in
a small wicker tray, for wiping the face after the meal, being the
sole concession to Japanese custom. As he sat facing her, he watched
appreciatively the dainty grace with which her slim fingers, long
practiced in agile manipulation of chopsticks, managed easily the
unfamiliar silver. She was enjoying it, flushed a little, happily. He
knew he would gain pleasure from this germinating friendship.</p>

<p>He wished to call a taxi, but she restrained him. "No, Uyeno is not so
far. We will go by tram."</p>

<p>But why bother about a crowded tram? Taxis were not such a luxury.</p>

<p>"But they are a luxury. Why should we spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> money needlessly when the
masses of the people must ride in trams or even walk. It is wrong." Her
earnestness amused him. The deep seriousness of her expression lent her
a charm as that of a child artlessly philosophizing. What odd surprises
they held, the minds of these Japanese girls, ideas shaped from
impressions gained God knows where. They compromised on an auto-bus.</p>

<p>The exhibition was crowded. It had always pleased him to note the
character of the people who thronged such places, art galleries,
concerts, theaters, high and low, rich and poor, a great number, in
fact, persons to whom even the smallest fee must mean sacrifice of
some material need. And here they were, as usual, small merchants,
poorly paid artisans, some even fairly close to the coolie type,
solemnly, seriously viewing the pictures, saying but little, absorbing,
gratifying a natural, spontaneous love of beauty. What would happen to
a New York bricklayer should he suggest to his mate that they go to see
the Metropolitan Art Gallery? The grotesque contrast of the idea amused
him.</p>

<p>They went through the Japanese art section first. He always enjoyed
this part the best, for while he had small technical knowledge of art,
he sensed a subtle gratification from the consummate perfection which
the artists of Nippon had attained in this field of their own where
century after century of painstakingly striving lovers of beauty had
succeeded in gradually climbing higher and higher towards fashioning
in concrete form the mirages of their vision. The eye rested, filled
itself with the wealth of delicate beauty of pure, surely drawn lines,
marvelously blended symphonies of color, almost imperceptible nuances
of shade and tint, a myriad of infinitely carefully elaborated details
which the makers contrived to weld into perfectly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>balanced, full-toned
consonance. There were the tremendous six-leafed screen paintings,
incidents from legend or history of feudal Japan, knights in armor
with long two-handed swords, archers with bow and quiver, women in
scintillating kimono and elaborate coiffure, or, of even more ancient
period, in simple flowing robes and with hair falling loose over their
shoulders, reminiscent of the art of China, the original inspiration
whence Japan had worked out that which was now her glorious own. There
were landscapes on screen or scroll, serrated crag and cliff with
gnarled pines overhanging foaming stream or glittering waterfall;
quaint and charming bits of life of old, or still existing but ever
disappearing Japan,&mdash;dancers in graceful postures, young girls in
boats, slender lily hands lying languidly in limpid waters, brown old
men, sickle in hand, garnering the rice, each ear of hundreds drawn
with veritable botanical accuracy of detail, still retaining the free,
swaying grace of nature.</p>

<p>It always cost him an effort to leave this section to enter that
devoted to art after Western fashion, which was constantly, year after
year, encroaching on, elbowing out of the way that fashioned after the
ideals of old Japan. A few years ago there had been only a couple of
these modern rooms; now those of the old and the new were almost even;
soon the latter would predominate entirely. It seemed such a pity; it
irritated him, the relentlessness of this march of progress? Still, it
was in its way more instructive than the other, gave concrete, graphic
illustration of the ideas and ideals of the young generation, what it
was seeking, striving for, more or less uncertainly, but always coming
nearer to the goal ever shimmering before it, mastery of the modern,
the new culture.</p>

<p>They were improving. Every year the exhibitions showed more certain
mastery of technique, better grasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> of the spirit of the French art
which seemed to be the almost universally accepted school. Kent
admitted it to himself grudgingly; every step in advance in this
direction meant defeat of the old. What would it all amount to, after
all? Even if, with their amazing facility for copying, for imitation,
they might produce work which was creditable, which might pass muster
even in Europe, as, in fact, some of the things he saw before him
might, they would probably never climb out beyond the mediocre, would
never attain original achievement. There were some very good portraits,
excellent flower pieces, though, of course, this was but natural,
considering that this subject was a preëminent favorite with the
Japanese schools. Even some of the landscapes were undeniably fine,
though, he noted, this was the case especially where some Oriental
subject had been chosen, great, carved junks with blood-red sails
glaring in the sunlight against a faint blue sky; mountain scenes
following largely the composition of <i>kakemono</i> subjects, the delicacy
of the latter being replaced by the more massive boldness made possible
by the medium of canvas and oils.</p>

<p>He felt that he was ungenerous; still it irritated him that they
should be making such headway in their apostacy. Only the nudes gave
him an incongruous sense of satisfaction. They were atrocious and the
exhibit was cluttered with them. In the old art of Japan, <i>kakemono</i>,
color-print and screen, they were virtually unknown, but during the
last few years the craze for them had swept over the moderns like an
obsession; the very fact that they were utterly new to Japan, the
sense that they were unconventional, modern, outré, was undoubtedly
the reason. So there they were, scores of them, clumsy masses of
female flesh, blatantly brazen, in all sorts of absurd and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> contorted
attitudes&mdash;and all these women were not nude, they were naked. The
conception of the spirit, the idea of their French masters, the verve,
the <i>élan</i>, they had missed it all. The paintings were bad, and the
sculpture, with which the rooms were filled, was worse. Evidently these
young enthusiasts had rushed forth fanatically intent to place on
canvas something naked; almost anything would do. The clumsy, paunchy
forms, shapeless limbs, invariably thick ankles, all seemed to indicate
that they had found their models where best they might, among country
wenches and servant maids, bringing forth on canvas or from clay mere
lumps of flesh, utterly soulless reproductions of female kind.</p>

<p>Did they really wish to convey the idea that Japanese women looked like
that? Did they wish, barbarously, to slaughter the conception of the
<i>musume</i>, delicate, graceful, beautiful, and to substitute therefor as
the ideal mere worship of flesh of the flesh? Damn them, it seemed such
stupid, wanton brutality, brutishness even; a grossly sensuous libel
on the womanhood of Japan. He glanced at Adachi-san, slender, dainty,
flower-like. How was such a grotesque misconception possible?</p>

<p>He felt that she should have resented all this; but she was interested,
far more absorbed in the moderns than she had been in the exhibits
after the ancient mode. This was the section which young Japan enjoyed.
Here the art students thronged, proud of their achievements or those
of their fellows, young men with velvet jackets and baggy trousers,
flowing ties and broad-brimmed, flapping hats. Their coarse, black
hair flowed loosely down to their shoulders; those who could manage it
had painstakingly cultivated little Van Dyke beards. Nearly all wore
enormous, horn-rimmed spectacles. Here they were in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> element,
prideful, self-certain in their assurance that they had advanced far
beyond the <i>hoi polloi</i>, that they were the leaders. Conspicuously they
would form groups, point out, discuss, criticize or go into raptures.</p>

<p>Evidently Adachi-san was quite well known here. Young fellows would bow
to her, some would even address a few short remarks. She was plainly
enjoying it all; she tried to communicate some of her enthusiasm to
Kent, called his attention to work which she thought was well done.
She even used some of the technical patter of the students. He wished
he had been better informed in art, that he might have placed in
convincing form the criticism which craved for expression. He was
relieved when they left the exposition and began their return through
Uyeno Park.</p>

<p>They found a seat at the edge of an abrupt slope where they had a
wide view of the city. "You didn't care for it, Kent-san?" Her voice
conveyed her disappointment.</p>

<p>"But I did. I like the truly Japanese things immensely; but that's just
it, even though much of the modern stuff is very good&mdash;I won't deny
it&mdash;it seems to me such a pity that Japan should sacrifice the wondrous
values of her own art merely to trade them for imitations of that of
the West which the other countries can do better than she can; just as
Japan in all other things is throwing away her own which suit her,&mdash;her
dress, her architecture, her manners, only to replace them with shoddy
foreign clothes that don't suit Japanese figures; ramshackle hodgepodge
buildings after no style at all; and all the rest. And then these
student fellows. Can't you see that with most of them it is all pose?"</p>

<p>A couple of the artists passed, bowed courteously. He raised his hat to
them.</p>

<p>"But it isn't pose, at least with only a few of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> If you only knew
how some of them slave and toil for the ideals they have, you wouldn't
talk like that. They may seem absurd to you, or funny even, but I tell
you, you would have a different idea of them, if you only knew them."</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay they must be interesting to know." Throughout the
afternoon he had sensed an indefinite resentment that she seemed to be
so familiar with them. How did she come to know them so well? It was
not jealousy, still, honestly, it might be something fairly close to
that. But the whole thing irritated him. He wanted to get away from it,
to some other subject. "It is getting quite late, Adachi-san. Let us
have dinner somewhere."</p>

<p>But she would not get away from it. "Thank you very much, Kent-san.
You're too good to me. But if you really think they may be interesting,
why shouldn't we go to one of the places where they eat, right near
here. Kent-san, you are the only foreigner whom I know, and you seem to
be such, such a reactionary, and I want you to see our side of it. You
foreigners ought to be the ones to help us, you know. I want you to,
please." The slim, white hand was on his sleeve. She was looking at him
earnestly, appealingly almost.</p>

<p>Hang it, the power which these eyes had over him; they could make him
do anything, he felt. Of course, in a way, that was what he wanted, to
allow himself complete abandon, inertly drifting, dreaming under the
spell of that glorious, pervasive beauty, to let himself go under the
hypnotism of her charm. But this was something entirely different; the
injection of the element of intellect spoiled the whole thing. It was
her beauty, not her brain he wished to enjoy, as one might be dreamily
soothed by the spell of a picture, unheeding the mechanics to which
it owed being. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> was her function, beauty. Why should she disrupt
the harmony by bringing in thought, this crass, clamorous new thought
that seemed like a plague of fever obsessing the new generation? "Our"
side of it, she said. He wanted her to be Japan of droning temple
bell, slender pagoda, rich, flaunting silks, not the Japan of steam,
electricity and new thought. But her earnestness softened him. He would
make the best of it. To-day, they had fallen into the wrong setting. He
would contrive, next time, one more congruous with the idea which he
had in mind.</p>

<p>"All right, Adachi-san, you shall be the guide."</p>

<p>She was radiant. "Kent-san, you are so good. I want you to be pleased,
and I feel that you are not pleased, but I want you to know us too, me
and my friends, and to like us, if you can."</p>

<p>They passed down the broad stone steps into a vast space of clanging
street cars and jostling crowds. Then down a side street, a few
blocks. She pointed to a sign, a gaudy female, presumably symbolically
representing art or some such abstraction, holding in one hand a palm
leaf and in the other a paintbrush. Over it was the inscription, in
<i>kata-kana</i> characters, "<i>kafue montomarutoru</i>"; of course, that meant
"café Montmartre."</p>

<p>He knew scores of the queer new cafés of Tokyo, but this one was of a
type new to him. There were the same rickety tables and chairs, but
crowding the walls, leaving scarcely an inch of clear space, were vast
oil paintings, tremendous stretches of canvas, all depicting nudes, in
every possible position and surrounding, in bath houses and by mountain
pools, posing in front of mirrors or just standing upright vacantly,
without apparent intention at all; huge figures, clumsy, ill-formed, a
mass of light-brown or pink, indelicate flesh pervading and dominating
the entire room. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The tables were crowded, the long-haired, bespectacled ones had
evidently here a habitat, a homely Parnassus, where they might worship
that which they conceived to be art, amidst an atmosphere of beer, bad
cooking and the eternal nudes. They found seats at a table with some of
them, who smiled and made room with great politeness.</p>

<p>It was an odd mess. Still, since he was definitely in for it, he might
as well do his best to draw from the incident whatever he might. But he
could not get over the incongruity of it, Adachi-san, dainty, modest,
with only an inch or two of clear ivory-tint below the throat showing
under the embroidered <i>eri</i> neckband, surrounded by this mob-like
throng of utter nakedness.</p>

<p>"And do you really like all that?" He swept his hand disparagingly
towards the walls.</p>

<p>"Ssst," she placed her hand warningly on her lips. "Please don't talk
so loud, Kent-san. He made them, the proprietor over there. He runs the
restaurant for a living, but he paints, too, these things."</p>

<p>Were they all going crazy; even second-class restaurateurs snatching
moments between steaks and chops to worship fanatically at the new
shrines? He was about to speak, to express to her his wonder at these
ever more astounding revelations, when he became aware that some one
had come up to them, a Japanese of about thirty, less conspicuously
bohemian than the others, still apparently one of the artist tribe. He
bowed with quiet dignity to Kent. "I beg your pardon, but I couldn't
help overhearing, and I should like very much to know what you think."
He turned to the girl. "Please, Adachi-san, won't you introduce me to
your friend."</p>

<p>She was plainly pleased as she made the introductions. Kent was a
friend, she blushed a little. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> newcomer was Sugawa, "a great
artist," she added, "one of our best."</p>

<p>Sugawa smiled to Kent. "Women exaggerate so," he remarked in perfect
English. Then he fell back to Japanese, evidently for the benefit
of the girl. "I saw you at the exhibition this afternoon, and now
again here, and I am sure that you don't like what we do. You are an
American, are you not? I thought so. And you know we Japanese like
Americans for their frankness, the American frankness. I wish you would
tell me just what you think about it, and, if you care, I'll tell you
just what we think, what we are trying to do."</p>

<p>"The American frankness." That was the usual prelude, the favorite
gambit for opening a conversation in which Japan drew out skillfully
the thoughts and views of America, but only so seldom gave like return,
remaining unrevealed, unknown, behind that curiously baffling wall of
national reticence. His courtesy had been perfect, disarming; still
what business had he to come breaking in upon them like that! "American
frankness." He probably wouldn't like it when he received it, but since
that was what he asked for, he should have it, in full measure.</p>

<p>"In the first place, I must tell you that I am no artist and have but
small knowledge of such matters, but I can tell you how I feel, how
probably most of us foreigners feel when we see you lightly abandoning
the immeasurably fine heritage from your forefathers to make mediocre
offerings to foreign idols." He swept on, expressed his feelings just
as he would have spoken to Kittrick or Karsten; it became almost a
tirade. He began referring to pictures he had seen that afternoon,
things he particularly remembered; but as he went on picking into
bits, relentlessly, this and that painting, the clumsy clay images,
the other's face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> showed no resentment, expressed instead absorbed,
intelligent attention. Kent felt that he had gone a little too far and
wished to tone it down a little.</p>

<p>"Even if you, some of you, at least, have done surprisingly well,
especially considering the shortness of time, what particular good
will it do? Even if in time you should bring forth a Gauguin or a
Matisse, the others are doing all that; you will have but added to
the cumulative results; whereas in your own field you are unique,
undisputed masters of an art that is valuable and fine, that will
become lost if you fellows don't follow it up. I hope that I have not
offended you, but it seems such a pity."</p>

<p>The other smiled. "No, of course I'm not offended. I asked for
frankness and got what I asked for. And, you know, it is not new to
me, this feeling of you foreigners that we should continue along the
old line. That's what my teachers were telling me, in America and in
Paris. That's what you Westerners always want, in art, in architecture,
in dress, customs, life, to have us remain the quaint, exotic, strange
country. You are like the people who think it a pity that a pretty
kitten must grow up to be a cat, and who would like to have a child
remain always a child. On one hand you praise the adaptability with
which we have acquired your civilization, and on the other you hate
to see the old, quaint Japan go&mdash;to see it change so as to become but
one more of the many countries of the earth which are so much alike.
You feel that the world is becoming too much the same all over, that
London, and New York, and Paris, and now Tokyo will be all the same,
will afford no new, strange sights and sensations; that Japan is being
lost as a charming playground for you. But what about us? In the first
place, we wanted to remain as we were, but the foreigner forced us to
become one with him. No,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> he smiled, "I don't resent it. I am glad
it happened, but the fact remains. You praise us for adopting your
civilization, and still that doesn't mean only building steamships,
and railroads and all that. That's the least part of it. That's
superficial. What really counts is our emancipation from feudalism,
from the rule of the few masters, attaining expression of the
individuality, and that's the real Western civilization which Japan,
the Japanese people, has just begun to grasp. Then why shouldn't we
follow our own wishes, each his own, each man, for instance, painting
as he pleases, old style, modern style, after Hokusai or after Gauguin.
You say that we are not producing the art of our forefathers, but you
don't see Europe producing any Titians or Tintorettos. Of course, so
far we are only imitating, we are learning, copying, but why shouldn't
we some day do as well as you do, maybe even better? Now we have joined
in the march of progress of common civilization. We can't go backwards,
we can't remain stationary. We must go on. Art is only one phase of the
whole thing, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he was interrupted by a jangling of bells, clamor of voices.</p>

<p>"<i>Gogai!</i>" the hoarse shout came in from the street. "<i>Gogai!</i>"</p>

<p>An extra. They were rushing to the windows, the door. "Hey, come here,
in here."</p>

<p>A little old man ran in, breathless, amid a jingle from a bunch of
small bells clustered from his belt. Under his arm he held a bundle of
small printed sheets, the <i>gogai</i>, extras, great news of some kind.
They all crowded around him, tore the papers from him as he gathered in
their coppers.</p>

<p>Tokyo had been in a fever of excitement for days. The discovery had
been made that a score of carloads of the arms left in the care of the
Japanese army when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> the Czecho-Slovak troops retired from Siberia, had
disappeared. At the same time Chang Tse-lin, the Manchurian war-lord,
had received, from some mysterious source, a large amount of war
supplies. The newspapers almost unanimously accused the militarists,
the General Staff, of having engineered the transfer, in spite of
Japan's agreement with the other Powers that none of them should
supply the warring factions in China with arms. Dual diplomacy, the
General Staff calmly overriding, for its own sinister purposes, the
international pledges made by the Foreign Office. The accusation which
the Japanese press so resented when made by foreigners was shouted
by all the papers. And the people took it up. Now had finally come
the time when the issue had been fairly made, when the yoke of the
militarists must be overthrown by the rest of the Cabinet. Breathlessly
the nation watched for the struggle.&mdash;But the General Staff haughtily
denied the charge. They knew nothing of it all. A major in the army
"confessed" that he was responsible; he had sold the arms to a Russian
faction with which he sympathized. It was all his own, personal doings.
He took all the responsibility. His wife committed suicide; she would
not face the disgrace. The nation cried out. She was one more innocent
victim of the juggernaut of the General Staff. Her husband was another,
a scapegoat, a martyr. Of course, no one believed his story, a palpable
invention to save the skins of his superiors. Now, what would the
Premier, what would the Foreign Office do?</p>

<p>The <i>gogai</i> brought the answer. The Premier issued a statement,
setting forth in tedious detail the opera bouffe proceedings of the
court-martial. He confirmed the whole thing.</p>

<p>"The cowards!"</p>

<p>They did not stamp their feet, or bang fists on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> tables; repression
was too ingrained. But as they read through the sheets, calling the
attention of one another to this or that paragraph, disappointed,
disgusted, sickened, hissing sharp staccato syllables between clenched
teeth, it was as if the atmosphere had become charged electrically with
waves of resentment, repressed hate, palpable almost as heat waves,
sinister, ominous. The militarists had won again, as usual; but what
of it? They had been brought a step nearer the eventual, inevitable
debacle. It might seem on the face of it Oriental patience, passivity,
but one could feel the tenseness of cumulative, restrained sense of
outrage, injury. It was the constantly mounting head of steam in the
boiler again.</p>

<p>But Kent had no time to study effects. He looked at his watch; only a
little after nine. He would have time to cable. "Here, quick, call a
taxi. Bring the bill, <i>hayaku</i>. Adachi-san, come along, please. I've
got to send this thing right away."</p>

<p>A small closed car arrived. They climbed in. Immediately Kent set
himself to composing a draft for his message. Sitting thus together,
her warm, lithe body close to his, he sensed unconsciously the pleasure
of her presence, but his mind was intent on his work, confining in the
laconic form of a cable message the gist of the event. He read it over.
Hang it, he should have liked to have seen the official communique
which the Foreign Office must have sent out, but there was no time. He
must take his chance on the <i>gogai</i>.</p>

<p>"Kent-san," she was leaning closer to him. "And now you are going to
send that by the cable over to America. When will the papers there
print it?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow the news will be all over the United States, all over the
world."</p>

<p>"It is wonderful. How interesting your work must be. What have you
written?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>He read it to her, pleased, with a feeling that her interest was
drawing them together, that in some way, as yet undefinable, they were
being brought into that intimacy which he craved.</p>

<p>She listened intently, a tiny furrow between the black crescent brows,
thinking. "Kent-san," she said suddenly, as if she had arrived at a
decision after careful deliberation. "You can add that the Premier does
not believe the explanation of the General Staff; that he has told them
so. It isn't fear of the fall of the Cabinet only that keeps him from
making deeper investigation. The secret of it all is a question of the
old clans, the Satsuma and the Choshu. The Premier is Satsuma, General
Matsu is Choshu. The General threatened that if he were not backed up
he would make it a clan fight, Choshu against Satsuma, and he would,
too. They stop at nothing, these militarists. And Viscount Kikuchi had
to straighten it out, to show them that if the governing classes fought
among themselves at this time, it would give the people, the masses, he
calls them, a chance. These old rulers know they must stick together,
the old, the iron-hard men, the feudalists, against the people, against
young Japan. Oh, it's so bitter, Kent-san, not only class against
class, but generation against generation, even among the aristocracy;
father against son, even. Some time you should talk to young Kikuchi,
if he'll agree to talk to you about it. That, Kent-san, that's the real
story."</p>

<p>In an indefinite way he had suspected that something like that was
the case. That enmity existed among the various departments of the
Government was an open secret, but this version, the clan fight, gave a
picturesque, human-interest angle to the story that he rather liked.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's interesting; but you know I can't send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> stuff like that
unless I'm sure it's correct. How do you know? I must know that the
source is reliable."</p>

<p>The car stopped; they had reached the post-office. He jumped out; then
he leaned forward into the car. "Adachi-san, how can I know that it is
true?"</p>

<p>She stooped towards him. He was looking straight into these lustrous
eyes, brilliant, close. "I am telling you, Kent-san."</p>

<p>There was no time for debate; the cable office would close in a few
minutes. As he copied his message on to the printed blank, his thoughts
were racing, occupied with the girl's story. Should he take a chance?
He hesitated for a moment. "Persons in position to know"&mdash;his pencil
framed the words half mechanically. He felt an odd conviction that she
was right. The clerk reached over for the message; he was in a hurry to
get his work done and get away. Well, let it go.</p>

<p>He found her standing in the street beside the car. "Step in,
Adachi-san, I'll take you home."</p>

<p>"No, there is no need for the car now. I shall walk."</p>

<p>Again that peculiar prejudice against what she ingenuously deemed the
luxuries of the privileged classes. What a potpourri of quaint ideas
stirred in that brain behind those delicately curved brows, those
wonderful eyes, and yet she appeared extraneously so like all those
Japanese girls whom one saw casually, everywhere, thinking idly that
they harbored only thoughts of flower arrangement, tea ceremonial, or
the ordinary dreams and aspirations of girlhood. She had given him but
casual glimpses at her mind, evanescent, baffling flickers, stimulating
curiosity, tempting him to learn, to find out, to intimacy. So far
the day had given no opportunity for confidential talk; mischievous
mischance seemed to have been ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> bent, vexatiously, on intervening.
Now the walk might afford better chance.</p>

<p>She lived near Kanda-bashi, she said. They passed along the crowded
streets, crossed the Ginza and turned down the broad street along
the palace moat. Here there was no one. He took her hand, and,
hand-in-hand, child-like, as do young Japanese couples, they walked on.
But she was in no mood for personal talk. The moon; see how the light
refracted on the green-oxidized copper roofs of the palace buildings,
and the black reflections of the gnarled pines in the silvery water!
She was thoughtful, a little serious. He walked on with her, wholly
happy at the sense of her nearness, the softness of the small hand in
his, languorously content.</p>

<p>At the Kanda bridge she stopped. "Here I leave you. I live over there."
She indicated a dark mass of houses on the other side of the bridge.
"And thank you, Kent-san, you have been so good to me."</p>

<p>But he held on to her hand. "But, Adachi-san, first you must tell me
when I may see you again. I must see you, often, like this."</p>

<p>She smiled a little. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Of course. We shall be friends, good friends, shan't we?"</p>

<p>"But I am always so busy, really. I have so little time."</p>

<p>"Of course, you have time. Say Wednesday." She shook her head. "Well,
then, Saturday afternoon; then I know you have time. I shall wait for
you in Hibiya, at the fountain by the wistaria arbor, at noon, please."</p>

<p>But again she shook her head. He clung to her hand, insisting. Suddenly
she pulled it free, laughed. "All right then, next Saturday." She
moved away a few steps, then abruptly, impulsively, she plucked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> from
her hair a rose, held it over to him. "For you, Kent-san. Good-night,
<i>o-yasumi nasai</i>."</p>

<p>He stood holding the flower, watching her as she moved swiftly over the
bridge and disappeared in a narrow lane between the dark buildings.
He found a rickshaw. Despite subconscious realization that the day
had, after all, been drab, commonplace, disappointing, he felt in an
exalted mood. The trotting figure of the rickshaw coolie faded from
his consciousness; it was as if he were alone, with his thoughts,
dreams. What a wonderfully complicated little beauty she was, entirely
different from any girl he had known, had ever imagined; mysterious
with her passionate devotion to the new things, art, the political flux
and ferment, her peculiarly insistent abhorrence at the luxuries of
the rich, and then, finally, that inconsistent flash of coquetry. Now
he must carry on, get the explanation of all this, learn her thoughts,
attain intimacy. She piqued him with her elusiveness, but it added
to his zest. But what did he wish, after all? He enjoyed the sense
of being surrounded, enveloped in her beauty; yet he was not in love
with her&mdash;no, he was not&mdash;there was no desire of conquest, to embrace
her, to clasp her in his arms in possession. And still he had realized
distinct enjoyment at holding her hand. It was intensely interesting,
her evident acquaintance with the manipulation of the hidden strings
which actuated the secret workings of the government behind the
scenes. Yes, that also caused attraction; yet he had been drawn to
her, irresistibly, with the direct certainty which compels steel to
a magnet, even before he had heard a word from her, by the sheer
compulsion of her beauty. Hang it, it was all very puzzling, this not
being able to define what was really stirring within one's own mind.
Still, he was no psychoanalyst. He gave it up. He would let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> the thing
take its course, let fate work it out according to its own inscrutable
arrangement.</p>

<p>He held the rose to his face; yes, he was certain; of all the
incongruous, clashing incidents of the day, this was the one he liked best.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>The following morning Kittrick dropped in to discuss the news. But
there was little to discuss; all Japan was unanimous in the belief
that the official statement constituted but a very crudely contrived
whitewash. "I think though that the Foreign Office might have summoned
courage to challenge the General Staff had it been able to get
irrefutable proof that it engineered the deal to Chang Tse-lin," said
Kittrick. "But they failed to get it, so they were in fact quite wise
in not making a charge which they could not back up. I think, though,
that the Premier made a mistake in issuing the statement over his
own signature. Now he has tarred himself with the same brush as the
militarists, and if the world loses whatever confidence it gained in
Japan at the Washington Conference, Japan has only herself to blame."</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;&mdash;" began Kent, but he was interrupted by a noise at the
door, and the Great Nishimura strode in, radiant, flatulent with
self-importance.</p>

<p>"Hello, Nishimura-san," Kent waved him to a chair. "We were just
talking about the Premier's proclamation. What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Bunk!" He dismissed the matter with a scornful sweep of the hand.
"Gentlemen, congratulate me; I'm going to be a candidate for the House
of Representatives."</p>

<p>"Good for you; congratulations. What party will it be, Seiyukai or
Kenseikai?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's a detail that hasn't been decided yet. We shall find out
first which party seems to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> strongest in my native place where
I'm going to run; we're a little uncertain yet. But the most important
part, the financial arrangement, has all been fixed up, so probably,
gentlemen, a short time from now you shall address me as the Honorable
Nishimura, and, who knows, some day it may be His Excellency Nishimura.
Finally my talents are being recognized by the people that count. I
know the game, and I shall go far&mdash;and I shan't forget my friends." He
smiled effusively. "In fact, that's what I came in about, to see if
you two gentlemen would care to join me in a little celebration, just
us three. Now, you know, it is not the common thing for us Japanese
gentlemen to go to the Yoshiwara. It isn't done, at least not openly.
We go to geisha houses when we want relaxation for 'the tired business
man,' as you Americans say. But the fact is, an old client of mine
owns one of the first-class houses in the Yoshiwara, and to tender his
respects to me he has invited me to come with a few friends to his
place&mdash;so I thought you might like to come."</p>

<p>"Why, thanks, Nishimura-san, I think I'd like to go." Kent had never
seen the Yoshiwara. He had meant to see it, just as he had meant to see
the Imperial Museum and the tombs of the Forty-seven Ronin, some day,
ever postponing with the knowledge that he might go at any time. "What
about you, Kittrick?"</p>

<p>"Sure I'll go. The Yoshiwara isn't what it used to be, is it,
Nishimura-san?" The great man shook his head sadly. "Still we shall
enjoy the excellent hospitality of the coming Premier of Japan."</p>

<p>"Who knows?" he smiled deprecatingly. "All right, gentlemen, I shall be
here at seven with a car."</p>

<p>The car he brought must have been one of the largest in Tokyo, an
enormous thing with an interior <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>resplendent with mirrors, cut-glass
flower holders and manifold glittering nickel trimmings. "Not a hired
car, this," explained Nishimura. "It belongs to the Watanabe interests,
my backers, who are now assisting me. Step in."</p>

<p>They swept through Tokyo, through a dimly lighted section of narrow
streets, emerging presently into a quarter where great buildings,
brilliantly lighted, presented a vivid contrast to the surrounding
squalor. "Here we are," announced Nishimura. "The nightless city of
wine, and song, and beautiful women. You have nothing like that in
America."</p>

<p>"I'd like to take a look around before we go to your place," said Kent.
"Do you mind?"</p>

<p>"I shall show you the place, and then you two can walk about a bit. I
shall wait for you. I cannot well be seen in these streets, you know."</p>

<p>Their destination was an enormous house, three-storied, gorgeous
with elaborate carvings and gilt ornamentation. Kittrick and Kent
set out down the wide street, bright in the blaze thrown out from
the scintillating glare from the great buildings, all spotless,
prosperous looking, glittering with light and tinsel. Along the
front of each house ran a great hall-like space. One entered and
faced a show-window-like arrangement, where rows of large portraits
of women, each bearing a name, appeared, set in variously arranged
backgrounds of gilt screens, vases with flowers, heavy hangings of
brocade, excellently executed silk scroll pictures. At each end of
this was a small box, ludicrously like a pulpit, in which sat men, the
doorkeepers, who drove the bargains with the guests. Some sat silently,
impassively suffering the crowds to flow by, stirred to action only
when inquiries were made of them. Others were busy, after the fashion
of barkers at a fair, praising their wares, calling attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> to the
beauties displayed, to the cheap prices. In some houses huge open
gateways allowed glimpses of gardens, meticulously arranged with stone
lanterns, miniature shrines, grotesquely gnarled pine trees throwing
their shadows in the soft light flooding the space from the windows
above, each a delicately contrived, entrancing little fairyland,
inviting, alluring.</p>

<p>They passed down narrower streets, mere alleys, where the lights were
dim, the houses smaller, some displaying but three or four portraits,
and where the barkers were more insistent. But throughout it all
was noticeable the almost entire absence of women. Here and there,
especially in the smaller places, a painted face might be glimpsed for
an instant between parted curtains, titters might be heard behind drawn
<i>shoji</i>, and from above would come the strident whimper of samisen and
high-pitched female voices; but that was all.</p>

<p>As they progressed, the sameness grew tiring; one became irritated
at the monotony of these rows and rows of stiffly smiling portraits
staring at one, all so curiously alike that soon they gave the
impression of a vast composite picture.</p>

<p>"I don't see much in it," commented Kent. "It seems to me drab,
tedious. Many of the settings are fine, beautiful even, but so much
of it is sordid, these barkers and the pictures, the gross commercial
hawking of women with as little feeling as if they were meat in a
butcher shop. I can't see the temptation."</p>

<p>"You came too late," said Kittrick. "You ought to have seen this place
a few years ago, when the women were displayed, when these fronts
faced right up to the street, showing the girls behind gilded bars.
You could look down an entire street, a blaze of light and gorgeous
color. Here would be a dozen girls with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> high coiffures, whitened faces
and painted lips, all clad alike in costly silks, gold and crimson,
set against a background of heavy brocade and among massive, carved
<i>hibachi</i> and mirrors; here, in the next place, would be a score of
women in purple and silver, shimmering against hangings of soft-toned
velvet; farther on would be another row, in dark blue and white, in the
background marvelous carvings and dwarf pines and flowers, and so on,
as far as eye could see, a kaleidoscope of glittering and glimmering
gilt, and lacquer, and bronze, and constant, restless flittering of
soft textures, blazing colors, riotously bewildering, all decking and
displaying thousands of women for sale,&mdash;a truly barbaric phantasy of
the Orient, where, if one could forget the beastly commercialism of
it all, one might at least have a picture, flamingly, prismatically
dazzling eye and imagination. And then came the reformer. He pointed
out, quite rightly, of course, that it was degrading to the great
Japanese nation to have its women displayed, like animals, in cages. So
they put an end to that part of it, the beauty, the splendor, and did
away with the only excuse that the Yoshiwara ever had for existence;
for then, by the gods, you might well have called it one of the Seven
Wonders of the World."</p>

<p>They returned to the house where Nishimura was awaiting them. A flock
of servants, male and female, attended them. They were evidently
honored guests. In a large room, they found Nishimura and his host.
It was enormous, hall-like almost, with spotless <i>tatami</i> matting, as
usual with only a low table, effulgent in crimson lacquer, some soft
silk <i>zabuton</i>, but the few ornaments, an ancient <i>kakemono</i> in the
<i>tokonoma</i> recess and a couple of vases, were evidently antiques of
great price. Nishimura introduced the host, a patriarchal gentleman in
rich, black silks, white-bearded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> dignified, incongruously venerable
when one thought of the nature of his commerce.</p>

<p>"You understand, of course, that our coming here like this to-night is
altogether unusual," explained Nishimura. "Ordinarily guests to come
here must first have gone to the introducing house, to get admission.
This is one of the best houses, and it doesn't take in people just from
the street. But we're friends, and you don't even have to pick your
ladies from the portraits. You shall see them all in the flesh. It's a
great honor."</p>

<p>The old man smiled benignly, clapped his hands.</p>

<p>Patter of feet and swish of silks in the corridors beyond. Then
suddenly a sliding partition moved aside and a score of girls tripped
into the room, arranged themselves in a long, curved row about the men,
stood there, like soldiers for inspection, all clad alike in crimson
and gold, some haughtily indifferent, others smiling or tittering, a
flaunting picture of color, crimson lips, white faces, black hairdress,
shimmering wealth of soft undulating textures.</p>

<p>The old man swept out his hand towards the line of girls. "Please,
gentlemen, select from among these unworthy women the ones whom you
wish to serve you."</p>

<p>The white men were a bit embarrassed. It was very difficult to choose
in such an array of beauty. They pointed, hesitatingly, almost at
random, to two girls, who left the row slowly, knelt on the mats before
them. One of the older girls was picked by Nishimura. "The oldest are
the best," he advised.</p>

<p>The other girls moved out, procession-like. "And now, would you care
to see my poor place?" The host rose and they followed him. It was a
vast building through which he led them, tier upon tier of rooms set
in a square about a garden, dark-green foliage <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>refracting the soft
shimmer of light filtering on all sides through the rows of <i>shoji</i>;
through the verdure might be glimpsed clumps of flowers, a tiny stream
with a miniature red, high-curved bridge. They walked through a maze of
corridors over dark, brilliantly polished hardwood floors, a labyrinth
of passages and stairways, past score upon score of rooms. Throughout
was noticeable an air of taste, artistically planned arrangement of
pictures, furnishings and ornaments, all spotless. The whole thing
bore an air of refinement, delicately restrained artistry, perfection,
vitiated only by the uneasy thought lurking ever in the background of
the mind, the pity that all this beauty should be devoted to the most
sordid commerce of man.</p>

<p>They returned to the first room, and immediately a throng of servant
women, soberly clad in dark kimonos, their unpainted faces a relief
after the array of bedizened vendors of beauty, brought the bewildering
multitude of courses which made the banquet. Hot sake was served in
small stone bottles. At the elbow of each man sat the girl of his
selection, watchfully keeping his cup filled. Nishimura's handmaiden
was busy; he expanded in talk.</p>

<p>As he flowed on unendingly, he became interesting with the intimate
details of his affairs. It was informing; still it struck Kent that,
after all, he was their host, and he must not be allowed to unbosom
himself unwisely. He managed to whisper to him. "Aren't you a bit
frank, Nishimura-san; remember these women may talk."</p>

<p>Nishimura laughed. "How little you know about the customs of Japan,
Kent-san. Don't you know that we of Japan, we statesmen and business
men, transact our most important business to the pleasant accompaniment
of women, geisha generally, of course, but this is the same. Why,
big business deals are closed the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> when the presence of beauty
stimulates the brain and makes more receptive the mind of the man you
deal with. That's why such is no business for striplings who would let
their thoughts wander, but for us maturer and wiser men. Have another
drink, Kent-san, and talk safely, as freely as you please. Or possibly
I have bored you?"</p>

<p>He hastened to reassure him. "No, not at all; on the contrary, it is
all intensely interesting; only I can't understand just why you're so
eager to get into the political game. You are making money from your
business, and politics must surely interfere."</p>

<p>"Ah, how little you know of politics. Now I shall instruct you." He
leaned back on his cushion, drew a deep breath, expanded, reminiscent
of the fabled bullfrog. The woman beside him hastened to fill his cup.
He drained it and held it out to her mechanically. She filled it again.</p>

<p>"You must know, surely, that in all countries business and politics,
economics, go together. That's why it's called political economy." He
had adopted a didactic tone, and frowned as if wrestling with ponderous
problems, pleased with his rôle as the instructor. "That's the way it
is in all civilized countries, only in Japan we have attained somewhat
greater perfection, coördination, yes, coördination." The word pleased
him. "Still even here it was until quite recently even better than it
is to-day. You remember the Manchuria Railway scandal, when such a fuss
was made because what had been gained, outside the rules&mdash;but what are
rules&mdash;had found its way to the coffers of the Seiyukai party; and the
Kwantung opium affair. Think of it, one official testified that he had
turned six million yen of opium money over to the party funds. That's
how parties may be made great and be able to see to it that trustworthy
men are elected to the Diet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> But then the Kenseikai stepped in and
caused trouble, foolishly forgetting that some day they may be in power
themselves&mdash;still, possibly they were actuated by some higher motive, I
don't know yet."</p>

<p>Evidently he had remembered that presently he might find himself a
Kenseikai candidate. The same thought struck Kittrick.</p>

<p>"But you said that you didn't know whether you'd be a Seiyukai or a
Kenseikai candidate. Now, which party platform conforms the most with
your principles?" He grinned.</p>

<p>Nishimura waved his hand impatiently. "Oh, platforms! When I was in
the States I heard of that all the time. Platforms!" He snapped his
fingers. "In Japan we do not tie our statesmen's hands with foolish
platforms. We observe the events when they happen and shape our actions
accordingly. Wise men do not cross bridges till they come to them. We
have no party platforms, at least none to speak of."</p>

<p>"But what do your parties amount to, then?"</p>

<p>"It's the men that count. Our people vote for the men whom they trust,
whom they know to be wise. It's the men that count."</p>

<p>"But you haven't explained yet why you're so eager to get into this
game?" broke in Kent.</p>

<p>The great man sighed and composed himself patiently to further
explanation, as might a man indulgently bear with the inept questions
of children. "Well, of course, you see there is power, and influence,
and also money, a great deal of money, if one knows the game."</p>

<p>"How much do you get as a member of the Diet?"</p>

<p>"Three thousand yen a year."</p>

<p>"And how much do you figure your election will cost you?"</p>

<p>"At least fifty thousand." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I don't see it. You are elected for four years, but the Diet may
be dissolved at any time, and then you are out. In other words, you
risk fifty thousand on a chance to gain a maximum of twelve thousand
and possibly only three. And I thought you were a business man."</p>

<p>The criticism irritated Nishimura, drew him out entirely. With
outstretched hand he warded off further questions. He held out his cup;
the woman filled it, and he drained it, composing himself to the task
of explaining elementals.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't pay that fifty thousand. That comes from the
Watanabe interests. You know, of course, that the future of Japan
lies in industry and commerce, and that's in the hands of the great
interests, the Watanabes, the Katos, the Oharas and the other big ones
and some smaller ones. These interests are patriotic; they know that
to succeed Japan must have in the Diet men with experience and vision
who will help their industries and make Japan great. So they see to it
that the right men are elected. The Watanabes, for instance, are very
patriotic and always figure on having about ten men in the House, and
the rest all have their own men whom they can depend on. That's why
they are helping me."</p>

<p>"Still, if you are elected, you only get the three thousand. That's
mighty little to pay for your time and trouble."</p>

<p>Nishimura was almost at the end of his patience, still he made a last
effort. "But don't you know that there are many others to whom a Diet
member may be useful. Some one wants to help build up Japan's merchant
marine, and he naturally needs a subsidy. So he comes to me, and I look
into the proposition and it seems worthy, and he pays me for my trouble
in examining it, ten, twenty, thirty thousand yen. And <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>another wants
the right to place signs on all the Government telegraph poles, and I
look into that, and I get another ten, twenty thousand yen. It is all
so plain; every one knows it."</p>

<p>"But it seems to me that comes pretty close to accepting bribes, and
you said just now that that proved unhealthy for the Manchuria and the
Kwantung officials."</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" He had to resort to English for emphasis. The host, who had
been sitting by wonderingly, compassionately tendered him a drink with
his own hands. He swallowed it hastily. "That's altogether different.
These are officials under the law, and such are not allowed to take
bribes; but we legislators, we're not officials under that law. Do
you think we could be expected to work for nothing. Of course, nobody
expects that. And then even the officials, nobody cares much. In the
opium scandal, Kata got only six months for accepting a bribe, and
some of the other big men got about that or less&mdash;and, of course, in
many cases the sentences were very properly deferred. You must have
read in the papers how it was given out that some of the leaders held
such high orders that they could not be prosecuted, because it would
be a national disgrace to send to jail men holding such honorable
decorations. Ah, some day," he sighed and held out his cup for more
sake, "some day I may be such a high official myself."</p>

<p>The host had seen that the guest of honor was becoming wearied. He
clapped his hands, the <i>shoji</i> slid aside and six geisha appeared,
with samisen and drums and bustled about, making ready for their
performance. The men stretched themselves out more comfortably. As the
geisha danced, the sake was passed ceaselessly. Nishimura was becoming
sleepy, yawned stentoriously. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>The host took the hint. "And now, Nishimura-san, would you retire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. I'm sleepy and a little, just a little drunk."
The host waved his hand and the geisha disappeared. The men arose.
Nishimura was led off, leaning heavily on his woman, arm flung over
her shoulder. In the doorway he looked back, smiling flabbily,
insinuatingly. "Well, so-long, gentlemen. Have a pleasant rest. <i>O
yasumi nasai.</i>"</p>

<p>The girl led him off, wobbling dangerously. Kent ran to her assistance,
and between them they managed to convey him precariously down stairways
and through long corridors, to her rooms. The woman sank to her knees,
bowed, her forehead almost touching the mats. "Thank you very much.
I am sorry that I have troubled you." She stepped into the room. The
partition closed behind her. Kent found himself alone. He looked about
for Kittrick, but no one was in sight. It was late. The samisen play
and singing had ceased. As he wandered through the long hallways he
lost his bearings in the vast, labyrinthic house. From the garden below
the soft plash of a fountain came up to him. In the silence the great
gilt carvings, intricately fashioned lanterns hanging from the eaves,
shining surfaces of lacquer refracting lustrously dim light filtering
through paper <i>shoji</i>, the air of beauty, still, dream-fraught, brought
the impression of a fairy palace asleep. But as he faltered on, seeking
the room whence he came, past row on row of rooms, closed <i>shoji</i>, he
sensed rather than heard a minute quaver of sound, the faint sibilance
of a multitude of whispers, coming from all about him, from behind
frail walls and paper partitions, stirring of unseen men and women,
titillation of restrained giggling, indefinite, intangible, blending
into a vague murmur, a composite, infinitely low, indistinct background
of sound. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, there you are. I have looked for you everywhere." He heard a soft
laugh behind him. It was the girl who had sat with him at the feast.
"Come." A soft little hand clasped his. He had been perplexed at his
helplessness, alone in that great house, silent except for the subdued
murmur of bought caresses, purchased kisses, the parody of love played
by these poor, painted houris behind the <i>shoji</i>. So he suffered her to
lead him on, uncertain as to what was about to come, still relieved at
having again definite destination.</p>

<p>"Where is my friend, the other foreigner?"</p>

<p>Her slim hand indicated vaguely the long row of closed sliding
partitions before them. "There, somewhere. Now, these are my rooms;
please enter." She placed a silk cushion in front of him, sank to the
floor, prostrated herself before him, face held low towards her hands
spread flat on the <i>tatami</i>, waiting.</p>

<p>"Thank you." He squatted on the cushion. She rose.</p>

<p>"Tea?"</p>

<p>"Please." With deft fingers she brought out the minute paraphernalia,
doll-like cups and teapot, poured hot water from the kettle simmering
over the glowing charcoal in the <i>hibachi</i>. He looked about; speckless
as usual, and dainty, cozy. She had managed to give the room an air
of personality, almost homelike, pathetic, with a doll enthroned on
a little couch of her own contrivance, her small cupboard showing
through glass doors frail china, figurines, temple charms, souvenirs
from little excursions which formed the great events of her life. The
partition to the next room had been slid aside. He glimpsed chests
of fine-grained, unpainted wood where she kept her finery. A pile of
crimson silk <i>futon</i>, great wadded quilts, formed a bed on the floor,
almost filling the tiny room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> He finished his tea, then she indicated
the room beyond.</p>

<p>"And now, danna-san, if it pleases you to retire, I shall change my
kimono."</p>

<p>He looked at her. Through the evening he had hardly noticed her, as
she sat behind him, silent, self-effacive, like a brilliantly colored,
hardly perceived shadow. How young she was, and how expressionless
her face, unlined, untouched by the exactions of her sorry
trade&mdash;almost like that of the doll over there, vapidly pretty with
its eternal smile. "No, I think not, not now." He noted the wondering,
half-frightened expression on her face, and hurried on. "What's the
name of your doll?"</p>

<p>Her face brightened, became alive. "Oh, that's Tamayo-san, tamayo, egg,
you know, because she's so fat. I have two more. Would you like to see
them?" He would. She brought them out. This one had been sent her from
her father, from Kiryu. As she prattled on, he drew from her her little
history. Daughter of a tenant farmer; she had worked at silk spinning.
Then the house had been destroyed by a typhoon, and, like several other
girls in her village, she had gone to the Yoshiwara, snapped up by one
of the agile agents whom news of the disaster had brought to the spot,
alert for business. "They paid fifteen hundred yen for me," she said
proudly. "But then, this is one of the best houses, and then I was only
sixteen. I am eighteen now."</p>

<p>"Was she unhappy here? Would she not like to go home to her people?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, I'd like to go home. Sometimes it's bad here, when
the honorable guests are drunk and rough; and some of the other girls
are mean and tell lies, and cause trouble. They are jealous of me, and
of Yurike-san, and Ainosuke-san, because we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> the most popular and
make the most money. You know, it's fun every month to go down and look
in the big book, for, you know, they must show us our accounts, and
see how much you have saved. For I am saving. I'm not like some of the
girls who spend all their money on clothes and foolish things and are
always in debt. But here the master is pretty good, and in a couple of
years I'll have a thousand yen all my own. In some places the masters
are cruel and bad and keep the girls in debt always, so they can never
get away. No," she cocked her head with a quaint judicious air as if
she were gravely weighing the pros and cons; "it isn't so bad."</p>

<p>She spoke of the whole thing as if it were an ordinary business
proposition, as she might speak of work in a cotton-spinning mill,
or any other occupation. Did she then fail utterly to sense the
degradation of her sorry occupation?</p>

<p>"But what about the men then, these scores and scores of guests,
caressing you, fondling you&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, that <i>is</i> unpleasant, but then I don't think of them.
<i>Shikataganai</i>, it can't be helped. I don't give my heart to them; and
then in a few years I shall go home, with lots of money, and I shall
marry a nice man, and I shall have only him and love him. And then I
shall have babies, real babies, instead of dolls."</p>

<p>He was glad that she was like that, that the sordidness and shame
passed by her unnoticed, not thought of. Here was surely a "lotus
in the mud," as the proverb had it about these women, who, oddly
innocent, mind apparently untouched by the grime and depravity of her
surroundings, contrived to keep her spirit untouched, apart from it
all. But then, she was only a simple peasant girl, ignorant of moral
codes, undisturbed by considerations above physical comfort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> But there
must be others, more imaginative, more complex, with minds sensitive
to the constant insult offered by sensuous leer, sake-fraught breaths
in their faces, the compulsion of offering love, or the semblance
thereof, for a consideration of money, to a succession of unknown
men, unsympathetic, contemptuous, careless of their womanhood. As
the thought came to him that here, within the space of a few squares
of houses, were thousands of these women, many of them surely with
delicately adjusted girl souls, enslaved by circumstance to sacrifice
what would have been pure, sweet love aspirations, in this vast market
place of meretricious caresses, he could understand the indignation
of the reformer whom he had heretofore regarded, superciliously, as a
well-meaning meddler.</p>

<p>He was relieved at the arrival of Kittrick. His girl was with him. She
and Kent's companion whispered together animatedly. Kittrick yawned.
"Well, what about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you came. In fact, I was just wondering how I might manage to
slip out of this."</p>

<p>"All right, why not? We can make some excuse surely." Kittrick turned
to the girls. "It's getting late, and my friend has just got a bride, a
new one, and it's foreign fashion always to come home before midnight
during the first six weeks after marriage. My friend always does that
with all his brides."</p>

<p>"Really?" Had he told them that Kent has as many wives as Solomon they
would have believed it. The customs of foreigners were peculiar; they
might do anything. "How many has he?"</p>

<p>Kent counted his fingers. "Six, yes, six or maybe seven. So you see
it's time to go home."</p>

<p>"Bad man, that's not good to have so many wives; one, and possibly a
<i>mekake</i>, concubine, but one only is better." The small doll face was
very serious, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> shocked. So she had a code of morals, after
all. "But you're not angry?" The tone was solicitous, frightened. "Have
I not pleased you?"</p>

<p>"You poor little thing." He fished out a ten yen note, grasped both her
hands and slipped the bill between them. "See, that's for you. Go and
buy another doll, a foreign doll, and when you play with it, you can
think of me. It's a souvenir."</p>

<p>She came up to him, placed both her arms about his neck, raised herself
on her toes and pressed her warm, whitened cheek against his. "How good
you are. Are all foreigners like that? I wish you were not going. It's
too bad you have so many wives."</p>

<p>"I expect we had better go and say good-by to Nishimura," remarked
Kittrick. The girls led them to the room, but he was dead to the world,
snoring noisily, sprawling, arms outstretched over the disordered
<i>futon</i>, the woman sitting beside him, patiently stirring a fan. The
girls took them to the entrance. The streets were no longer crowded,
but a few stragglers gathered and watched them curiously as they sat
there, in full view, lacing their shoes. Of course, one knew what was
in their minds. The embarrassment of the situation was the finishing
touch.</p>

<p>"Whew, I'm glad to get out of this." In the silence of the deserted
street, dim now and drab, as the brilliance of the lights had given
way to a faint glimmer, the only sounds were their footsteps and, in a
distance, the clamor of a watchman's clappers. Kent was ill at ease and
wanted to get away from these great, quiet houses, from the sense of
knowledge of the sordidness, of the lives of all these women stirring
fitfully behind these walls. A policeman obligingly found them an
automobile and they started home.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it, Kent?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am mainly disgusted, old man, still, I am just now too confused
by clashing impressions to know just what to think. I feel so damned
sorry for these women, and yet, oddly enough, that little girl of mine
was not particularly unhappy. The shame and the hideousness of it all
passed right by her. She might have been far more unhappy in a spinning
mill. In a few years she'll pass out of it, marry, and forget all about
it. But, of course, there must be others, girls who are fine-souled
enough to suffer from the constant degradation that is offered them day
after day, every day. The whole damned thing ought to be abolished."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's one side of it," said Kittrick. "Sometimes I'm inclined
to agree with you; but then again, at other times I'm not. It's the
old question of regulation or no regulation, and it is still an open
one. At home we have taken the other tack, but I wonder if we're much
better off. You know San Francisco, where you may go out any night
and pick up girls, just like these, not held in such bondage perhaps,
but, on the other hand, furtive, frightened poor devils who are no
better off, who have not even the sense of security that the girls
have here. We hear of Piccadilly and Leicester Square. The trouble is
that as long as men, or at least a great many men, are what they are,
women will be sacrificed. The question is the same here as elsewhere;
there's something to be said on both sides. It's rotten either way.
I've never been able quite to make up my mind which is best, or worst.
But, here in Japan, there is at least one thing in their favor, and
that's the marvelous way in which the Japanese manage to place a veneer
of artistry, of beauty, externally anyway, over this thing. Of course,
we have our opulently gorgeous palaces of sin and all that but they
seem flaunting and garish when compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> with Japan, where even in
this they manage to convey a surface of estheticism, delicate beauty,
cleanness, with their spotless rooms, fairy gardens and the rest. It is
reflected even in these girls who seldom show the loose sensuousness,
the brazen, commercial harlotry of our women of that class. And one
thing is certain, these girls here in the case of the lower classes,
and the geisha in that of the more well-to-do, have served to preserve
the purity of the Japanese married woman. It's the existence of the
Yoshiwara and the <i>machiai</i> that turns the Japanese philanderer away
from the other man's wife. And seeing the tangles and triangles of our
cities, the rotten divorce cases, and knowing that the Japanese family,
the unsullied virtue of the matron, is the corner-stone of the Japanese
Empire, I'm hanged if I can't at least understand the reluctance of the
Japanese in tackling this matter, disgusting and tragic as it is."</p>

<p>It was after midnight when he reached the house, but Jun-san was
waiting for him. She never retired to her own little house in the
garden until the men were safely home.</p>

<p>"You are late, Kent-san." She smiled, stepped closer, peered at him.
"Ah, so you have found one at last. The other night it was a rose,
and now&mdash;&mdash; So she is Japanese." The smile left her face. "Kent-san,"
she took his hand in her earnestness, "Kent-san, it is so seldom that
happiness comes from this, a foreign man and a Japanese girl, but, if
you must go on, be kind to her, please."</p>

<p>She slipped away. He shivered a little. Poor girl; it was distressing,
this air of tragedy which always seemed to cling like a shadow to this
beautiful, lovable woman, uncomplaining, with her soft dark eyes. He
could envy Karsten to have the love of a woman like that. He felt
lonely. Life was drab, tedious, selfish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> Would he ever gain such love
from some woman. So Jun-san thought he was traveling on that road. The
rose, yes, but what could she have seen to-night? Women were always
like that, even Jun-san, ever imagining.</p>

<p>He went to his room, began to undress. A glimpse in the mirror made
him look more closely,&mdash;a white smudge on his cheek. Ah, that was it,
a smear of <i>o shiroi</i>, powder from the cheek of the Yoshiwara girl.
He wiped it away hurriedly. Damn it, if he should enter into love
relations with some Japanese girl, it would not be one like that. The
thought of Adachi-san came to him. Yes, a girl such as she; still, his
mind insisted, this was not the sort of relation he wished to enter
into with her. And if, after all, he did, what would come of it, how
would it end? He thought of Jun-san's words, "so seldom happiness comes
from this." How devilishly complicated life was, a Scylla or Charybdis;
did one steer clear of one rock one banged into the other. He turned
off the light impatiently and climbed into bed, but thoughts would not
leave him, the oppressive, stifling atmosphere of sorrow which lay
broodingly over the household&mdash;why could not happiness come from a
relationship like this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>With the approach of Saturday Kent became impatient. The feeling of
being alone, that there was in the whole world no one who was really
interested in his affairs, who cared whether he lived or died, took
hold of him and he chafed under a desire for some one who would care,
for the close touch, the intimate relationship which is possible
only between man and woman. That was what he wished from Adachi-san.
He thought it out carefully, made certain that he would eschew all
semblance of dalliance. Jun-san was right, what could such lead to but
sorrow, heartbreak. But he wanted her friendship, a sort of brother and
sister relationship. Even though it was common to scoff at platonic
intimacy, such must be possible, and in this case, with the definite
absence of passion, erotic desire, it surely must be possible if ever.
So it should be thus; he would regard her as a fair flower, attaining
his enjoyment from being near her, allowing himself to be suffused by
the effulgence of her beauty, disdaining to break the charm of purity
and delicacy by soiling contact of too ardent hands.</p>

<p>As he awaited her, in the wistaria arbor by the fountain, he enjoyed
a feeling of serenity, of having laid out a wise and safe course,
one which would avoid the anguish and regrets of love passion. As he
noticed her at a distance, hurrying towards him, dainty, picturelike
under her brightly hued parasol, he became elated with a feeling of
gratification, pride, that this beautiful, winsome girl, the equal of
whom one did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> not see in weeks or months, should be thus hastening to
him.</p>

<p>She was in a gay mood. "You know, Kent-san, it's the first time I ever
had a meeting with a man like this. And still I know that it's right
for a man and a woman to meet thus, if they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If they what?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," she laughed, a little confused. "Where do you wish to go,
Kent-san?"</p>

<p>He left it to her. She decided on Shiba Park. It suited him admirably.
He had hoped that she would select some place like that, typically
Japanese. Somehow the surroundings of the former occasion, the strident
modernity of the new art, the exaggerated imitation of the Quartier
Latin atmosphere by the students, had vitiated the picture which
he wanted to form of her. But here, as they wandered slowly under
the huge, gnarled cryptomeria trees, among the ancient shrines and
sepulchers of the Tokugawa shoguns, with their century-old carvings,
hundreds upon hundreds of great stone and brass lanterns, silent halls
with woodwork wrought into infinitesimally minute details, myriads of
gilt ornaments, fantastic tesselated ceiling squares, one felt oneself
brought back into the age of feudalism, peaceful, reverend in the
brooding calm which lay over this place. Here she blended into, formed
an integral part of the surroundings. The bright colors of her kimono
with its great bow-like obi-girdle arrangement, her clear, refined
Japanese features seeming to supply the last touch of artistry which
infused this gorgeous medieval setting with the vitalizing breath of
life.</p>

<p>And her thoughts came into harmony with it all. Modernism faded
away; she told him the old histories connected with these shrines,
imaginative, picturesque; quoted the ancient proverbs, bits of softly
cadenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> poetry. This was how he wanted her to be; how marvelously she
contrived to translate into living reality the indefinitely glimpsed
dream of his imagination. He became immersed in well-being, absolutely
complete, delicious pleasure. They dined at a Japanese tea house facing
a garden, another perfect composition where nature had been persuaded
rather than compelled to arrange the components, fine traceries of
maple leaves, broad, flat stones in a winding pathway down to a
tranquil bit of water, forming together the perfect picture where no
ill-placed pebble or broken twig might intrude on harmony.</p>

<p>During the days which followed he enjoyed a sense of elation, triumph
that his dream had at last come true, the ideal attained. This was
perfection, just as he wanted it all, the girl herself to be. With this
he could be fully happy, content. Sitting in his office, smoking idly,
he found pleasure in living over in his mind every incident, every
detail of this delectable adventure.</p>

<p>"Telephone call for you, Mr. Kent."</p>

<p>He roused himself, irritated. Hang the telephone and all modern
contrivances which mankind had worked out painfully to plague it.</p>

<p>"Hello, hello, who's that?" he inquired briskly.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Kent-san?" By the gods, it was she. He felt as if he must
be trembling visibly in his eagerness. "Yes, yes, this is Kent-san."</p>

<p>"I thought you might care to come over for some tea." He could hear
her laughter. These prosaic wires had their excellent uses, after all.
"Yes, thank you, of course, I'll come right over."</p>

<p>As he scrambled up the stairs he noticed that the offices were
deserted; the promoters of Japanese-Bolivian harmony and the rest had
left early, apparently. She received him, smiling mischievously. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> am
so sorry to have disturbed you, but every one goes home so early here,
and I felt a little lonesome. So we shall have tea."</p>

<p>After that he came often, in the late afternoon, and chatted with her
about the events of the day, the modern music, art, pictures, or,
again, about old Japan, the ancient fables, beliefs, poetry, as her
mood would have it. It seemed as if she possessed two distinct and
complete personalities, one the quaint, conventional, yet emotional
maiden of old Japan, the other the eager, nervous young intellectual,
thirsty for knowledge, for attaining progress. They became very
intimate. He learned that her first name was Sadako, so after that
he called her that only, and she came to call him Hugh,&mdash;Heeyu she
pronounced it. They made short trips Sundays, into the country, to
Kamakura, Inagi, up the Sumida River, to temple festivals and street
fairs. Thus it remained. At times he might hold her hand, simply, like
that of a child, but that was as far as it went, as far as he craved
to go. He had attained the fulfillment of his desire for constant
enjoyment of her charm, her beauty, her companionship, intimate,
serene, undisturbed by desire to go further.</p>

<p>One Sunday they made an early start and went farther afield, to the
Hakone region. At Miyanoshita they left the little electric train,
and lunched Japanese fashion at the Goldfish Inn. Then they wandered
on down, along the road winding between the steeply sloping mountain
sides, drinking in the coolness, enjoying the sweep of green bamboo
and maple trees clinging to the rocky walls above them, the murmur and
gurgle of the stream rushing, foaming, over great bowlders far below.</p>

<p>At Tonegawa where they went to the station to take the train back to
Tokyo, they found a group of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>excited people on the platform. They were
talking, gesticulating, children with arms filled with wooden trick
boxes and other souvenirs regarding curiously their agitated elders.
The station master was telling his story over and over again, repeating
it to every new arrival, arguing and explaining. Yes, they might go to
Odawara in the electric train, of course, but there was no way of going
beyond that, to Tokyo. The steam trains were not running. Yes, they had
stopped; they had all stopped. The entire Imperial Railways system had
stopped. It was a strike, a universal strike. No, he knew very well
that that had never happened in Japan before; but it had happened now,
just as it had in America and England. He couldn't help it. They could
go to Odawara for all he cared, but there was scant hotel accommodation
to be had there. They had better stay in Hakone where there were many
hotels. Yes, the trains were not running&mdash;he began to explain again to
some newcomers&mdash;there was no getting back to Tokyo at present.</p>

<p>"Well, evidently we are in for it, Sadako-san. The man is right. We
had better find some place here. I have heard there are good hotels in
this village." She had placed her hand on his arm, seemed irresolute,
frightened. "You are not afraid, are you, Sadako-san?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not afraid of you. Come, let us go."</p>

<p>They found an inn in Tonegawa, a huge building with great wings,
many-storied, striving up the hillside, seeming, like the trees, to
cling precariously thereto. The inn people were a little doubtful. Yes,
no. They had only one room left and that was really not a room at all;
it was a banquet hall, not used for sleeping. The other hotels? No,
they were crowded, too, with the unexpected rush of holiday seekers
left stranded here. Yes, he might have the big room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> Other refugees
were approaching down the road. Kent made up his mind. "<i>Shikataganai</i>,
Sadako-san, we must make the best of it. All right, I'll take it."</p>

<p>A maid servant led them through long passages, up steps, along a long
passage, up more steps, then through more corridors and stairways, ever
upwards, bewilderingly; it seemed as if they must be mounting into the
clouds. Finally he noticed overhanging eaves; thank God, this must be
the top story; they could mount no higher. The girl led them down a
passage, drew aside <i>shoji</i>, ushered them into a vast room occupying
the entire width of the building, showing a great <i>tokonoma</i> recess
with a splendid scroll picture, a bronze statuette of Ebisu, the
fattest and jolliest of the Seven Lucky Gods, grinning them welcome.
There were great gilded screens, several huge mother-of-pearl inlaid
<i>hibachi</i>. Quite evidently this was a hall for special feasts.</p>

<p>The maid brought tea and comfortable kimono. "The bath?" she inquired.
This was a hot-spring hotel, sought by people from all over Japan for
its natural hot mineral water. "I shall get dinner ready while you are
in the bath," she added, evidently with the thought that this foreigner
might not know the common custom.</p>

<p>"I want to arrange my hair first. There is no mirror here." Sadako was
already in the doorway. "Please excuse me a moment."</p>

<p>She disappeared. He waited, not knowing just what to do. It was
embarrassing, this bath suggestion. The maid became impatient. "Will
you not take your bath now?" she insisted. Very well, he would solve
the difficulty by going first. He got out of his clothes and into the
kimono. The maid led him down through the maze of corridors, miles it
seemed, to the ground floor, into a hall-like space, with shelves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> for
clothing, where were standing half a dozen persons, men and women, half
nude or nude, getting ready for or leaving the baths. He turned to the
servant. "Where?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere," she indicated a row of doors. "There are three baths,
but they are all full. It is no use to wait. There are so many guests
that there will be no empty rooms. Please enter." She was in a hurry,
began to untie his girdle. It was embarrassing. In other inns where he
had been, the rule separating the sexes had been observed. Still, they
all seemed so unconcerned; he must do in Japan as the Japanese do.</p>

<p>He doffed his kimono and placed it on a shelf. The maid held open a
door. As he started to enter some one from inside was about to pass
out. He stood aside; a young matron, about thirty, and two little
girls, all absolutely nude. He noted curiously that in his surprise
there was no hint of being shocked, they were so natural, without hint
of embarrassment. Came to him instead an odd sense of purity; the
impression was like that of a graceful doe with a couple of fawns,
nothing more.</p>

<p>The room was spacious; three sides were of finely grained wood, the
fourth wall being the natural hillside with small shrubs growing in the
interstices among the mossy rocks whence jetted the hot spring water,
effervescent, into a rill in the immaculate tile floor leading to the
tank, a huge thing, about three feet deep, filled with crystal-clear
water. The room was so large that there was not even the veil of steam
which usually half obscures the bathers in such places. On the floor
close to him were a couple of Japanese men, rubbing themselves with
towels, preparing to leave. A little farther over were three women, two
very young, rinsing from their bodies the soap which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> covered them with
a creamy foam; the third, a little older, was having her back rubbed by
the old bath-man.</p>

<p>Kent took a wooden bucket and dipped water from the tank, poured it
over himself, found a diminutive wooden stool and sat down to soap
himself. The men left and he was alone with the women. They paid no
attention to him, ignored his presence altogether. What a graceful
picture they made, holding high the small buckets whence they poured
streams of the sparkling water over their smooth, slender bodies,
ivory-gleaming, creamy, almost white. The bath-man poured water over
the oldest girl, and all three climbed into the tank. Then he turned to
Kent and began to massage his back. The girls were chatting gayly. He
wished they would have finished before time came for him to enter the
tank. But the bath-man had completed the rubbing; now he was sousing
him with clean water. "Please, danna-san, step in. This water is very
healthful."</p>

<p>There was nothing for it. He went to the edge. The girls regarded
him disinterestedly. "Please, excuse me." He noted surprise in their
glances; evidently apology had been superfluous, out of the ordinary.
They said nothing. He started to climb in hurriedly, to hide his
embarrassment, but drew back with an exclamation. The water was much
hotter than he had expected. One of the two younger girls tittered,
tried to control herself, but failed. The other became infected by it,
tittered also uncontrollably; from giggles they went into laughter,
grasped each other's hands, bodies shaking, sending ripples scurrying
over the mirror-like surface.</p>

<p>"Oh, do keep quiet," the older girl managed to repress a smile.
"Please, don't mind them. They're very rude, but they are so young.
Anyway," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> added, "you should come into the water quickly; then you
don't feel the heat so much."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much." He plumped in. It was not so bad, after all.
"It is hotter than any place I have ever been before," he explained,
ashamed at having flinched.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is hotter here than in most places," said the girl. "So you
live in Japan?"</p>

<p>One remark led to another. The younger girls joined in. Soon they were
conversing freely, Hakone, the weather, and particularly the news of
the strike, the great event of the day. As they sat there, letting the
heat from the water seep into their bodies, an undercurrent of thought
kept running through his mind, minutely probing analysis into his own
thoughts, his impressions from this astonishing situation. Yes, here
he was, with these three young women, side by side almost, immersed
in this water which offered no more concealment than glass, and yet
his sense of embarrassment was leaving him, had left him; even the
feeling of unconventionality disappeared. He felt no different than
he might have, had he been sitting with them, fully clothed, in a
café. Curiously, there was not even hint of suggestive thought, erotic
inspiration. The utter absence thereof puzzled him a little. Men might
experience such at the fashionable seasides of America where female
beauty chose to adorn itself with wetly clinging textures, boldly
cut garments, designedly piquant, stirring curiosity with artfully
contrived faintness of concealment&mdash;while here the very absence of
suggestion, of thought on the part of these women of the man-woman
idea, produced an effect of naturalness, purity even; one would feel
ashamed of harboring fancies of sensuality. And yet these girls&mdash;they
were quite evidently gentlewomen&mdash;would have blushed in shame should
they, when on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> the street or any place other than the bath, suffer
accidental exposure of even the slightest bit of bosom; they would
disdain being seen in the daringly cut evening gown of Western fashion.
In the bath this was natural, obvious; one did not bathe in clothes;
this was evidently the idea.</p>

<p>They climbed out and prepared to leave. He watched them, as they stood
erect or knelt in easy, graceful attitudes, as he might have looked at
a picture. He was pleased that he had grasped the idea, the Japanese
attitude of mind, that a man might look at a woman, unclothed, without
taint of thought of sex.</p>

<p>"<i>Sayonara.</i>" The girls smiled to him. An elderly couple came in.
He climbed out, dried himself and passed out into the hall, donned
his kimono and started back for the room. He mounted a flight of
stairs, went down a corridor, climbed more stairs, occupied with his
thought of the incident in the bath. Presently he faced a storeroom
filled with great heaps of quilts. He tried to retrace his steps, but
wandered into another part of the house which was unknown to him.
Lost again, another labyrinth. He would inquire; but he did not even
know the number of his room. The servants were all busy elsewhere.
He asked a couple of young men who passed to show him to the top
floor. They laughed at his predicament and undertook to guide him,
but the floor they finally reached was as unknown to him as the rest
had been. As they wandered along the corridors they could look into
many rooms where withdrawn partitions showed each its separate little
scene, parents with children, young couples, large families, groups of
students, all eating, drinking, discussing the strike or their own more
intimate affairs. Here and there the two young men would make inquiry,
explaining the contretemps. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> excited merriment. Others joined the
search, became lost in their turn, pointing out directions, finding
themselves baffled; still more joined the fun. It became a procession
of young fellows and girls, highly amused, laughing, thoroughly
enjoying the childish adventure. How likable they were, lovable in
their ingenuousness; no hint here of racial antipathies. They took
him in as one of themselves in this fine game which had happened so
fortuitously to beguile the time. Kent came to enter into the spirit of
the thing, the infectious spirit of hilarity, with the assurance that
they were laughing with him, not at him; that they were all friends. He
was almost disappointed when a maid who knew where he belonged came to
his rescue and led him back amid laughing calls of "good luck" and "<i>go
yukkuri nasai</i>," "don't be in a hurry to leave," from his host of new
friends.</p>

<p>A few moments later Sadako-san returned to the room. "So you have
bathed too, Kent-san?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; and why did you give me the slip like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew that it would be like that, with so many people here,
bathing together. Certainly, I did not want to bathe with you."</p>

<p>"But when you bathed, did you not bathe with men?"</p>

<p>"Of course, but that&mdash;that's different."</p>

<p>"Because I'm a foreigner?" He was pleased enough that matters had
turned out as they had. Somehow, he felt, with her he should have
experienced a shyness and uneasiness, such as had not occurred with the
girls who were unknown to him; that it would in some odd, intangible
way have vitiated the state of purity of intimacy which he wanted to
maintain with her. But the suggestion that she, Sadako-san, should feel
the race difference, especially when these others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> had not thought
thereof, irritated him. "Just because I'm a foreigner?" he repeated.</p>

<p>She came close to him, took his face between her slim, small hands,
looked at him intently, reprovingly. "Hugh-san, you know that between
you and me that doesn't matter. These other men, I didn't know them,
but with you," she blushed furiously, "with you, I couldn't. Can't you
see? It's because you're a man you are so stupid. If you were a woman,
you'd understand."</p>

<p>In his turn he brought his hands to her cheeks, brought her face close
to his, looked deeply into these great, darkly luminous eyes which had
ever held such a fascination for him. He sensed a thrill pass through
him, delicious, suffusing his entire being. No; he caught himself.
This wouldn't do; he was slipping into dangerous waters. "Sadako-san,"
he said, holding control in his voice, "I understand, even if I am a
man, and&mdash;you're a dear girl." But still they held each other. He felt
a shivering, gasping tenseness, nervous, electrical, as if the next
instant must bring some new, astounding, overwhelming development.</p>

<p>Patter of feet in the corridor. They sprang apart, faced each other
embarrassed, in reaction of surprise at the nearness of love to which
their feelings had so unexpectedly brought them. The maid brought
supper. It was necessary to make an effort to appear natural, to get
back to the commonplace. The presence of the servant, unsuspecting,
business-like, arranging the table, helped them. They seated themselves
on their cushions, self-consciousness fell away; soon they were
chatting as if nothing had taken place.</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen. The lights were lit. The maid brought in huge
bundles of <i>futon</i> and arranged beds, great heaps of wadded quilts on
the floor, side by side. Evidently these two were man and wife, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
sweethearts; it was all the same to her. Sadako-san went out on the
narrow veranda, sat with her back turned to the room. The maid made the
finishing touches. "Good-night, <i>o yasumi nasai</i>." She left the room,
closed the <i>shoji</i>, the patter of her feet faded away down the hallway.</p>

<p>Kent went out to Sadako-san. She was squatting on the floor, head
resting against the low rail, staring abstractedly out over the
scattered roofs below, towards the hillside over which was rising a
white crescent moon, faintly silvering the trees along the ridges.
"Sadako-san." She gave no answer. Far down below the stream was
murmuring; cicada violins shrilled a quavering treble serenade.
"Sadako-san," he took her hand, drew her towards him, placed his
arm about her, brought her close, held her tightly. She offered no
resistance, her gaze directed fixedly, dreamily, into the distance,
sadly. The poor, dear, lovely girl. Suddenly all idea of abstaining
from caresses, from love, seemed distant, a thing utterly of the past.
As he felt the pulsating warmth of her body, sensed the beating of her
heart, the heaving of her bosom, the implied consent of her inertness,
that old thought of avoiding love seemed stupid, absurdly futile. She
was beautiful, lovable; they were young, what was life for? He loved
her. He turned her face towards his own. Slowly, looking steadily,
deeply into her eyes, he brought it close. Then he kissed her. They
clung lips to lips. Her arms went about his neck. The murmur of the
stream and the cicada violins faded into an indefinite, soft, distant
obligato.</p>

<p>"Sadako-san, I love you."</p>

<p>Slowly she drew her face from his, eyes wide as if in surprise, fear.
Suddenly she threw his hands from her, held out her own against him,
stared at him, lips parted. "Hugh-san, oh, Hugh-san, why did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> you do
it?" Her hands grasped the rail and she buried her face on her arms.
He could hear her sobbing. With gentle hands he tried to soothe her,
but the mere touch caused her to tremble convulsively, it seemed almost
hysterically. "Sadako-san, Sadako-san." He spoke soothingly as he
might have done to a frightened child. Gradually the sobbing ceased,
the nervous tenseness of her body gave way to passive inertness. He
contrived to place his arm about her. "And now, Sadako-san, little
girl, don't be frightened of me. I shan't hurt you, or kiss you, or do
anything you don't wish me to do. But don't you understand that I love
you? Don't you care for me at all?"</p>

<p>"Hugh-san, I know you are good. I am not afraid of you. I'd do anything
you want, but&mdash;I can't. It's impossible, oh, oh, Hugh-san." He could
see tears tremble on long, black lashes, enhancing the depth, the
luster of these dark eyes, the quality that had so overcome him when
he first saw her. Beautiful, unhappy, wholly adorable. "Sadako-san, of
course, it is not impossible. Dearest, I want to marry you."</p>

<p>But she shook her head, kept shaking it, rocked her whole body. Again
he soothed her, brought her cheek up against his. "Sadako-san, little
girl, what is the matter? Tell me, dear, only tell me." Presently she
straightened, took his arm from her waist, grasped both his hands, held
them, looked straight at him. "All right, Hugh-san, I shall tell you
all, all about myself. Then you'll understand.</p>

<p>"While I was still small, my mother died, and my father didn't marry
again; he didn't want me to have a stepmother. Oh, he was a good man,
my father. He was a professor in the Imperial University, in political
economy, and all he lived for was to make me wise and good. I went to
a good school and he taught me much himself, many things that he did
not dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> teach his classes, showing me how Japan is being corrupted by
the money evil, the big capitalist houses that are gradually sucking
into themselves all the money, all the treasures, all the happiness
of Japan; and the narikins, the new profiteers, who are like jackals
that take what the lions leave, so there's nothing at all left for
the people. He told me that all that was good, all that was fine and
noble about old Japan was being thrust out of the way by the money
worshipers; the samurai, the Bushido code, the splendid old courtesy
and customs, all were being sacrificed that these people might make
money, by any means, fair or foul, by corrupting the government and by
grinding down the common people. He told me so much about it because
he dared not talk to others. He was afraid he might lose his position
or even go to jail for harboring 'dangerous thoughts.' For himself he
wouldn't have minded that, but he was saving up money for my education,
for he wanted me to go to the big universities in America and Europe,
and every month he went down to Yokohama and put money in the Machi
Bank. I didn't care much about these things then, politics, economics;
I wanted to be a doctor; but later I remembered everything he had said.</p>

<p>"Then came the big crash in business and Machi failed. We lost all we
had; so did the other poor depositors. No one would do anything for
us; the rich men and the other banks were all sorry for Machi, who had
lost so many millions. But he still has his automobiles and his villa
at Hayama&mdash;and we had nothing. My father had been failing for some time
before that. Then he died. I am sure that disappointment killed my
father."</p>

<p>Her voice died away in a whisper. She fell silent, looked out over the
valley, absorbed in her memories. So she was another of the victims of
the Machi failure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> He had reason to remember the incident well. The
Machi Bank had been the first big concern to tumble in the crash, and
in working up the story he had learned his first astounding lesson in
Japanese high finance. Out of his bank's assets of some seventy million
yen, Machi had invested sixty millions in his own silk and menthol
speculations, and had lost it all. The very point made by Sadako-san,
the wave of sympathy for Machi on the part of the rest of the
plutocrats, the absolute unconcern regarding the depositors, had caused
him to wonder. He had interviewed one of Japan's leading financial
authorities, a high official in the Treasury Department, about it.
But it had been very unsatisfactory. Why, hadn't Machi lost all his
capital, millions and millions? Of course, one must be sorry for him.</p>

<p>"Then Machi is lucky that he's in Japan," Kent had said. "If he had
been in America, he would be in jail now." But the official had refused
to believe it. Why? Had followed a long discussion. Had they then no
laws whereby bankers were prevented from gambling with funds placed in
their care? The official had plainly thought that Kent was childish in
his ignorance of high finance. Did he not understand then that bankers
had to invest the funds entrusted to them; that was the very essence of
banking. But was there then nothing to prevent a Japanese banker from
investing the funds in his charge in a poker game or in roulette, if
he so pleased? No, naturally the Japanese Government did not wish to
limit its financiers in the exercise of their talents. And, anyway, of
course, the bankers did not put the money in poker games? No, possibly
not, but what about Machi? As a gamble, poker became a child's game as
compared with silk and menthol. The great authority had shown signs of
impatience; anyway, poker was gambling and silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> was business; every
one knew that, and, of course, there was always a certain element of
chance in business. Kent had tried once more. "But now that you have
the example of the Machi case before you, with more like that almost
certain to come, don't you think it would be well to regulate such
business by law? What do you trust to, anyway?" No, the Japanese laws
were quite satisfactory, quite, and the authority had drawn himself up
with great dignity. "We trust," he had said solemnly, "we trust in the
integrity of our bankers."</p>

<p>Kent had picked up his hat and had left. What was the use? Could you
beat it? Here Machi had gambled away sixty millions, and still they
babbled inanely about trusting in the integrity of such. At the time he
had felt intense sympathy with the victims, unknown to him, orphans,
widows, old men doubtless,&mdash;and now here he saw at first-hand one
of the countless little tragedies left in the wake of Japanese high
finance indiscretion. So she really had good reason for her peculiar
aversion to the plutocracy, poor little girl. He leaned forward,
intercepted her glance. "And then?"</p>

<p>"Then," she shrugged her shoulders. He hated to see the bitter smile
on these childishly curved lips. "Then I had no father, and I had no
money, all because Mr. Machi had wanted to take a gambler's chance to
increase his millions. But he kept his motor and his villa, and we,
whose money he had used, we kept nothing. Then I remembered what my
father had so often told me, and then I decided that I would do what
I could to help the poor against the rich, to do my share to put an
end to a government which allows such things, that cares only for
the plutocrats. So I got a job in a silk filature. I might have done
better, of course, but I wanted to see first what the life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> the
workers was like, and I had no money, anyway, so it made no difference.</p>

<p>"I thought I would begin cautiously; so I found a position in one of
the Ohara 'model mills.' I thought I was lucky. Of course, I didn't
like the looks of the high board fence that surrounded the whole
place and made it appear like a prison; and it was a prison, too,
I soon found out. They never let us out except on what they called
'excursions' and then there were always guards with us. They made a
great fuss about these excursions, but the fact is that most of us
stayed home to sleep&mdash;we could never get enough sleep&mdash;and then they
scolded us and said we were lazy and ungrateful. It was the same way
with the flower garden and the tennis courts that they were always
showing visitors&mdash;for it was a model factory, you remember. It is true,
we had the right to use them, but we almost never did; we were too
tired, we never had the time. We wanted to sleep, just rest.</p>

<p>"There were hundreds of girls in the factory, most of them young, who
had come there because they had been shown pictures of these fine
flower gardens and tennis courts and thought they would have a much
nicer time than they had on the farms or in the tenements where they
came from. I worked in a room with over a hundred girls, taking the
silk from the cocoons from the boiling water in great big kettles and
winding it on machines. We couldn't sit down and we couldn't speak or
hear others speak. We couldn't even look up from our task. The boiling
kettles made the heat almost unbearable and the stench from the pupæ
was nauseating. My head ached most of the time, and we had to work from
four in the morning until seven at night. Of course, I always wanted to
sleep, and I was lucky that it was a model factory, for the dormitory
was clean, even though there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> sixteen of us in each room; and we
were allowed a full <i>tatami</i>, a mat six by three, you know, each. But
even there the <i>futon</i> were thin and hard like boards. There had been
sheets once, some of the older girls said, but some had been stolen by
girls leaving the factory, so they had done away with sheets.</p>

<p>"I became just like an animal, only thinking of time to rest. I had
heard how in other factories the girls sometimes got better conditions
by banding together or by complaining. In one of the textile mills the
girls composed a song about the hem of the silk crepe shift of Mrs.
Ohara being dyed crimson with blood from working girls' fingers, and I
thought I would like to make up songs like that, do something to bring
the girls together, but I was too weak to think. Sometimes I was afraid
I might get consumption, as so many of the working girls do, but if we
were sick, they only scolded us and said we were shamming. I was sorry
I had come there, but I couldn't get away till my time was up. That's
what the fence was for. The food was poor, but I didn't mind that so
much, for poor food costs very little, and I had decided to save my
money so when I got out I might go to typewriter school."</p>

<p>Again she paused. She was looking straight at Kent; he could almost
feel her gaze, as were she trying to look into his mind, appraising him.</p>

<p>"You poor, dear girl," he tried to draw her closer. The thought of that
frail, sweet beauty being cooped up in that steaming hell that she had
depicted incensed him, made him want to take her in his arms and hold
her, protect her, comfort her. But she waved him aside impatiently.</p>

<p>"Hugh-san, don't caress me. I am going to tell you something I have
never told any one, and then, Hugh-san, you'll understand why you and
I can never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> be more than this, just friends. Maybe you won't want to
be even that then, but I'm going to tell you." There was an uncanny
high pitch of excitement in her voice. She was becoming overwrought,
possibly a little hysterical. He tried to quiet her. "No, Sadako-san,
don't think of these things. They are all over now. I don't want to
hear any more about all that. I shall take care of you and protect you."</p>

<p>"But you must hear." He could feel the small hands lying in his clench
tightly as she fought for self-control. She looked straight into his
eyes. "In that factory the Oharas themselves never came, but they had a
banto, a young clerk, who came often to look after the business. Once
when I was so sick that I had not been able to drag myself to work, he
inspected the dormitory and found me alone there. He was very kind. We
talked and we became very friendly. He said he felt sorry for me, that
I was different from the other girls and that he would get me better
work. And he did. I got a job in the office, and gradually things
became better with me. I saw him often then; and, Hugh-san," by an
effort of will she was keeping her gaze straight into his, "I came to
think that I loved him.</p>

<p>"Then one night, it was fine moonlight, and I walked out into the
garden. My work was not so hard, and I didn't have to think of sleep
always. There had been a little party over at the head overseer's
house, and that man, the man I'm telling you about, came back from
there, through the garden. He saw me. He had been drinking sake, but he
was not drunk, and I was always glad to see him, and I ran up to him.
But he just took me in his arms roughly, and pulled me over into the
shadow and forced me down on the ground, and&mdash;oh, Hugh-san&mdash;&mdash;" Her
eyes wavered, fell. She threw herself forward, on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> shoulder, voice
half-smothered, sobbing. "And I had really loved him. There in that
horrible factory, he had been good to me, and had helped me, and he was
the only one in the world who cared for me, and&mdash;and I think that if he
had only held me gently, and spoken softly to me and loved me,&mdash;yes,
Hugh-san, I think I should have done anything he wanted. But now I
hated him, even more than I would have hated any other man, and I shall
always hate him.</p>

<p>"And that's one more reason why I shall always hate capital and its
men, and that's why I have made friends with those who feel like I do,
the Socialists, the Communists and all those, the young men in Tokyo,
the labor leaders, the anti-militarists. That's why I finally managed
to get into Viscount Kikuchi's office, so I might learn all I could
about what they are doing, the bureaucrats and the plutocrats&mdash;and,
Hugh-san, that's the reason that I can't love you."</p>

<p>"But why, dear girl, why?" He gathered her into his arms. She did not
resist, yet he sensed in her body a sort of stiffness, coldness; the
flood tide of ecstatic emotion had passed. "But, Sadako-san, why should
you waste your future, why place your back on happiness because your
past has been wretched? Don't you care for me at all? Couldn't you love
me just a little if you tried?"</p>

<p>She raised her head, smiled up to him wistfully. "Yes, I think I could
love you, Hugh-san. But I'm not going to. I won't try. Can't you see
how impossible it is. I'm unclean. I'm soiled. Do you think that I
should want to come to you like that?"</p>

<p>He started to answer, but she placed a hand over his mouth. "Please,
Hugh-san, don't talk. Just let us sit like this; yes, hold me, just a
little while." She nestled close up to him, like a tired child, and
he held her, wondering at the unexpected and strange <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>perversities of
women in matters of love, the impossibility of foreseeing or refuting
the baffling obliquities of their reasoning. In old Japan such a mishap
might have been looked upon with the merciful eye of tolerance; and in
new Japan, the complaint of teachers in even the highest girl schools
was that the maidens were babbling sophisticatedly of free love and
the like. These young Japanese obtained their ideas from the oddest
corners of Western modes of thought, from chance-bought or borrowed
books, taking for gospel whatever they happened to absorb, be it from
long antiquated volumes picked up in a Kanda second-hand bookshop or
from the misconstrued conceptions of Western philosophy casually heard
from these fanatic professors and students. But where could she have
gotten this absurd idea that she was soiled, that her value, that
wondrous gift of beauty and charm, had been vitiated, rendered utterly
worthless, like that? At last he asked her, "Sadako-san, how did you
get such a foolish idea like that? Of course, you're good, and sweet,
and pure, and beautiful. You must never think of yourself as soiled,
unclean; it's unhealthy, absurd. Of course, you don't believe such
nonsense."</p>

<p>She answered, a little wearily. "But, of course, I do know, and you
know. I am a Christian."</p>

<p>He almost shook her. "Of all the foolish things! Who ever taught you
Christianity like that?" He tried to argue with her, became voluble.
He was not familiar with intricacies of doctrine, but surely this was
a ridiculously antiquated interpretation of the spirit of Christianity
of to-day, absurd, monstrous. He became voluble, tried to break down
or persuade. And, anyway, what was really Christianity to her? He knew
very well that many of the Japanese Christians were so merely because
it was <i>haikara</i>, modern, placed them a little aside from the mob in
the rôle of independent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> advanced thinkers. But why should she be like
the rest of the shallow fools?</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you say is true. There are many Christians like that.
Even my father, who first taught me Christianity, was like that. I know
he really had more confidence in <i>Nichiren</i>. But, Hugh-san, I am so
tired. I want to rest. Go in and sleep. I shall sleep here."</p>

<p>The recollection of the two beds in there, side by side, suggestively,
brought his mind to the problem of the moment. "Of course not, dearest.
Go in and rest. I can sleep out here." But she would not have that.
Both grew insistent. It seemed an impasse. Finally he went in and
dragged the two beds apart, one to each end of the long room. Around
hers, designated by the curved wooden headrest designed to support
woman's elaborate coiffure, he built a rampart with the screens.</p>

<p>"And now, Sadako-san, here is a place for you. Can't you trust me?"</p>

<p>She came up to him. "Of course, I trust you." She raised herself on
her toes, placed her hands to his head, pressed her cheek against his,
warm, soft. He moved his arms to clasp her, but she slipped away,
disappeared. He could hear the dropping of her garments to the <i>tatami</i>
beyond the barrier of screens.</p>

<p>When he awoke sunlight was filtering in through the paper <i>shoji</i>. He
called, "Sadako-san," but there was no answer. He went over to the
screens which guarded her, knocked, called again, but she had gone.
Evidently she had taken the opportunity to go to the bath.</p>

<p>He went out on the veranda, seated himself on the rail, back against
a post, reflecting. What a rack of emotional storm and stress had
suddenly swept upon them, engulfing them, unexpectedly, whirling them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
about like straws in a typhoon. So that had been the result of his
carefully planned pure, passion-free relationship; how little man might
control such things. And he had asked her to marry him. Jun-san's words
came to him. What if she had consented? He would then have been tied to
her now, for life. For life, with this Japanese girl! Would happiness
have come of it, not merely the swirling high tide of youthful passion
of the first years, but during the long years, decades, when constant
living together would reduce existence to the humdrum of every day. He
tried to imagine the situation a score of years hence, when she would
be over forty, when the glamor of youth, the sparkle of newness, the
exotic charm of kimono and strange ornaments should have passed away,
when her mode of thought would no longer be fresh and original to him,
but when the oddness of her ideas would have become stale, irritating
even. They might at such time be living in San Francisco, or New York,
or London; he did not intend to live the rest of his life in Japan. How
would life in such places be for them, an elderly-aged American and a
middle-aged Japanese woman? Marriage must have a firmer foundation to
build upon than mere attraction of beauty, spell, fascination of exotic
charm; to last it must depend on the ingredient of intelligence, common
growth of mind, ideals. His first marriage came back into his mind
warningly, and even there chances for endurance of the relation had
been so much stronger. And yet he did love this girl. Were it not for
the appalling thought of the possibility of what coming decades might
bring, he would not hesitate. Could he, for instance, be certain that
he would live but three, or five years longer, he would have insisted,
persuaded, won her by sheer impetuosity of wooing. But&mdash;&mdash; No, Jun-san
was probably right; did he venture to tie himself to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> girl for
life, he would be playing a game of chance with fate with the cards
probably stacked against him. And still he wanted her, craved for her,
would probably be able to overcome her misgivings; but what if he did?
Would not come the time when she might recall to him that she had been
right, that he had brought only unhappiness to her? No, he must give
her up.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, <i>asenebo-san</i>, sleepy-head." She had crept up to him
playfully, like a child and stood beside him laughing, radiant, with a
freshness like a flower from the bath. Not a trace of the soul-stirring
emotions of the night before. "Soon we shall have breakfast, and after
lunch we shall go back to Tokyo."</p>

<p>"You forget that the trains may not be running then. Have they had any
news down below?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it will be only a twenty-four hour strike. That was decided. Of
course, they don't know anything, the inn people, but I know." She was
enjoying her superiority of knowledge. "That was decided on some time
ago, only I didn't know it would come so soon. Don't you know that
while workers are allowed to organize unions, the Imperial Railways men
are not allowed to form them, because they are Government employees.
That's just why we wanted this strike, the first real nation-wide
strike, to come from them, just to strike fear into these governing
classes, to show them how powerless they really are. So a lot of
the most important railroad men, engineers and conductors, all over
Japan, wherever we could find them, were organized secretly, and we
trusted that when they struck the others would come along, for they
are all resentful since the Government cut the freight rates and cut
their wages for the benefit of the rich people who own the freight. Of
course, the authorities suspected something, but they couldn't find out
just what was going to happen and when it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> going to come off. And
they will punish a lot of the leaders, no doubt. But let them put them
in jail; it will only make us stronger. I'm so glad that this really
happened; we thought it would be almost impossible to bring it through."</p>

<p>How intensely he disliked hearing her talk like this. Who the devil
were these "we"? Why should this beautiful, slender girl be stirring
her white fingers in this mess. These words, the sordid jargon of
class passion and hate, seemed so grotesquely incongruous issuing from
rose-petal child lips that should have been humming the lilting songs
of maidenhood.</p>

<p>"Sadako-san," he could not keep impatience out of his voice, "what the
deuce are you doing in this mess, anyway? Such things are not for girls
like you. It will bring you only unhappiness. Why don't you drop it?"</p>

<p>"I have told you. Some one must do this work. I have no one who cares
for me; and there are many other girls in this, just as in your country
where women do their share. Why shouldn't Japanese women be as brave
and strong as yours?"</p>

<p>Damn this craze after modernity! He wished Japan had never been opened
to the Western civilization, to suffering the pangs of re-birth, the
seething flux of reconstruction that sucked so many lives inexorably
into the maelstrom.</p>

<p>She noticed his frown. "You are angry with me, Hugh-san. Is it because
I didn't tell you about this before?"</p>

<p>"No, I want none of your confidences about all that stuff; I don't want
to hear you talk about it." He snapped his fingers impatiently. Hang it
all!</p>

<p>"Don't be angry, Hugh-san. I was so afraid that this would happen. I
liked you so much. You seemed so honest, and then when I heard the
Viscount lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> to you, why, I just couldn't help telling you. I hate
all these militaristic plots, their subtle plans, keeping up to the
letter of their promise, but preparing all the time, in so many ways,
for war, for building up their machine in other ways. And so I told
you. I wanted to do anything to help stopping them, to hurt their
plans. But then, afterwards, I came to think it over. I'm Japanese, and
you're a foreigner. Oh, I trust you, but, after all, had I the right
to go against my own people, my own country? Oh, I thought over it so
long, and sometimes one thing seemed right and sometimes the other,
and I couldn't make up my mind, and I grew afraid; so I decided to say
nothing more till I was sure what was right. Now, don't be angry. I do
trust you, but&mdash;&mdash;" From the floor where she was kneeling she reached
up, grasped his hands, pulled him down towards her. He sensed the
trembling of her tightly clasping fingers, tenseness of her body. She
brought her face close to his, eyes intense, staring into his.</p>

<p>"Hugh-san, if you say that it is right, I'll tell you all that I know.
Anyway, I am afraid that soon I shall not be able to tell much, for I
think that they are watching me, that they will send me from Kikuchi's
office. But I don't care," her voice broke. "Oh, Hugh-san, don't be
angry with me. I'll tell you everything if only you say that it is
right."</p>

<p>Her face had become drawn; the eyes staring into his were bright with
luminous tears. It was as if he could feel on himself infection of
quivering approach of hysteria. He shook himself together. By the
gods, he'd have no more of these high-pitched, feverish scenes with
their trembling reactions. He wanted no news at such a cost. The girl,
this poor, fanatical flower-like thing, frantic under her visionary
obsessions, she was the only thing that mattered now. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose, lifted her and carried her high in his arms up and down the
length of the great room. "You dear baby," he rocked her back and forth
soothingly. "You dear pretty little baby. 'Rock-a-by baby in the tree
top.' That's how we sing to naughty little babies in my country." She
had struggled a moment when he picked her up, surprised, frightened,
but now she lay quiet; the tremble had left her, the flicker of
overwrought excitation in her eyes had given place to wonder; her body
relaxed, a wistful smile crept over her lips. "But, Hugh-san, I'm not a
baby, don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, you're only a baby, my baby, cry-baby. Listen, 'When the
wind blows, the cradle will rock. When the wind blows, the cradle will
fall, and,'" he gave her a great swing, "'down comes baby, cradle and
all.'"</p>

<p>He tumbled her into the nest of soft silk <i>futon</i>. She lay there,
laughing. "Oh, but you are silly, Hugh-san. I had never thought that
you could be like that. And what a funny song. Sing me some more like
that, and tell me what they mean."</p>

<p>He was overjoyed that the remedy had been so potent. He would have
her all right in a jiffy. Out of his almost forgotten store of Mother
Goose rimes he conjured the Old Woman who Lived in a Shoe, the Ride
a Cock Horse, and others; he remembered the fairy tales which had
delighted Kimiko-san and brought them to bear. But she liked the songs
best, insisted on his singing an odd potpourri of nursery nonsense
transformed into labored Japanese. The maid coming with breakfast found
them in high spirits.</p>

<p>After the meal, they went for a walk through the village. There they
heard the news; the trains would be running that afternoon. "I told you
so," triumphed Sadako-san, but he turned her attention to a bent-backed
crone who, he insisted, was the living image of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> the Old Woman in the
Shoe. He wanted no more of the other. At luncheon they had more nursery
entertainment. She was as happy, as eagerly receptive as a young bird
stretching out its beak clamorous for ever more food. It was wholly
delightful. Why could she not always be like that, this entrancing,
absurd girl revolutionist who could be enticed in a moment from Karl
Marx to Mother Goose?</p>

<p>They left for Tokyo in the afternoon, but the trains were crowded and
there was opportunity for only commonplace talk. From the Tokyo station
they walked towards Kanda-bashi. Seriousness had returned to her; she
said very little. "Kent-san, you have been very, very good to me. I
shall never forget it; and, I shall never forget you. And you won't
forget me, will you, not altogether?"</p>

<p>"But what are you talking about, Sadako-san? I shall see you again
often, as usual." He took her hand, but she was looking away from him,
over her shoulder. She pulled her hand away quickly. He followed her
gaze. In the shadow of the buildings on the other side of the street
he detected a slinking figure, indefinite, sinister in its stealthy
movement.</p>

<p>She turned to him. "So you can see yourself now, Hugh-san. It was just
as I thought. That man over there, he has been following me before.
I knew this must come sooner or later. No, come on, walk quietly. It
can't be helped." They reached the bridge. She took his hand, held it
between her slim fingers, gripping it tightly. "Good-by, Hugh-san. You
have been too good to me. How I wish&mdash;&mdash; I shall never forget how good
you have been. And don't forget me, Hugh-san&mdash;dear."</p>

<p>She pressed his hand again, turned, and disappeared in the shadows
on the other side of the bridge. From the other sidewalk the dark
form of the spy was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>watching. The swine! What filthy curs they were,
these masters of armies and battleships, to pester and harry a slight,
frail thing like this girl! He started for home and turned down a
side street. Suddenly he wheeled about. Yes, the fellow was following
him, inexpertly, but doggedly. Well, he would show the brute that
shadowing a man, a foreigner, was not such an easy game as badgering
a girl. Abruptly he stepped into the dark shadow of a narrow alley,
waited, fist clenched. What if he were a policeman; of course, trouble
might follow, but he would at least give him the drubbing of his life,
the swine! He waited, bent forward for assault, strangely elated,
expectant. But the minutes passed; he peered out. The fellow was not in
sight. Kent stepped out from the alley. No, he had disappeared. He had
smelt a rat, the damned coward!</p>

<p>Whew, what a day, and what a night! What a grotesque bedlam this was
becoming to be, this Japan in transition that he had begun to pry into,
this monstrous anamorphosis where the rare quaintness and daintiness
of feudal richness of thought and beauty were anachronistically
intermingled with the crass, clamorous ugliness of riotous, strident
cry, uneasy, hectic pulsing of dissatisfaction, hating mob thought. And
then this girl; she was like a flower ground in the relentless wheels
of some gigantic, pitiless machine&mdash;and he couldn't drag her out. What
a price Japan was paying for her modernism, with the fair, sweet souls
of girlhood tattered and wasted as a part of the sacrifice. This, then,
was the end of this relationship that he had hoped so much from. The
premonition was uncanny, overwhelming; he could not ward it off. This,
then, was the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>A few days later he went to Viscount Kikuchi's office. A young fellow
occupied the seat at the head of the stairway. "You are new here,
aren't you?" Kent ventured. Yes, he had come here only yesterday. Kent
tried a few more discreet questions, but the lad was uncommunicative.
Still his manner indicated clearly enough that he regarded himself as
a permanency. Kent was glad to learn that the Viscount was absent; he
would have hated to face those piercing old eyes. It was impossible to
tell just how much he might know.</p>

<p>For days he kept up the search, made occasion to linger about
Kanda-bashi, visited the places where they had been together. He even
had Ishii make inquiries, but beyond ascertaining that she had left her
lodgings at Kanda, he could learn nothing. Again he went for council to
Karsten. He laughed a little.</p>

<p>"By the gods, but you are the damndest man for losing ladies, for
futile amours. However," he added more seriously, "it's probably as
well that things have turned out as they have. The fact is that you
have not the light, care-free touch to make a successful philanderer.
You're a 'one woman' man. You take your affairs of the heart seriously,
and for that reason it's the more essential that you make no mistake.
As I say, you're a born monogamist. It's an enviable condition; you'll
be happy, serene, content with just one woman, provided you find the
right one. These affairs you have had recently count for nothing.
You've been lonesome, in a susceptible mood. Let it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> pass. Some day
you'll run into the right one and your problem will be solved for good.
And, one thing more, you're not the sort of a fellow who is cut out for
a Japanese woman. Run along, go to the dances, play with Kimiko-san and
the rest, but don't get involved, for their sake, for they take such
matters seriously and you have no right to cause them heartache; and
for your own sake as well, for you, too, take such matters seriously.
Go to work and forget serious thoughts about women, Sadako-san and the
rest. Heavens knows, there ought to be enough going on in Japan just
now to keep a newspaperman occupied."</p>

<p>It was true. The atmosphere had become hectic. The railroad strike
had alarmed capitalists and bureaucrats. The police were frantic,
and strike leaders and Socialists, any one thought to be harboring
the detested "dangerous thoughts," were being jailed right and left.
Strikes became frequent. Those who incited them were put away by the
police mercilessly. The method seemed successful, but soon the workers
resorted instead to what they called "sabotage," grasping fondly at the
foreign word, though the movement involved no violence, but consisted
entirely in organized effort to do as little as possible; "going slow"
was a more descriptive phrase for it. The men went to work as usual,
went through the motions of performing their tasks, remained at their
posts during the prescribed number of hours, but production fell to a
minimum. Machinery revolved as busily as usual, but raw material was
fed to it but sparingly; lathe tools moved around, back and forth, but
found no steel to shape, looms whirred hummingly but empty of fabric.
It was especially conspicuous in the case of the tramcar men, who would
run a car a block or so, stop for half an hour while making pretense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>searching for some break, then progress a block or two only to halt
again. Fights were staged in all the big cities between car crews and
irate passengers. The police were helpless; there was no way of making
men work quickly. The capitalists groaned; here were the economists
calling all the time for reduction of production cost in order that
Japanese goods might meet the competition of foreign wares, and yet
their output was becoming absurdly expensive. But the workers were in
high feather. Capital had closed so many factories and had discharged
so many workmen in order to keep the stock of goods in the domestic
market so low that prices would remain high&mdash;unable to grasp any theory
except that high prices meant high profits&mdash;and now it was compelled to
employ more workers in order to make up for the loss caused by the "go
slow" tactics.</p>

<p>Labor leaders, Socialists, Communists, Syndicalists, and all the
worshipers of half-understood 'isms found fine fishing in troubled
waters, certain of responsive audiences wherever they might find places
in which to shout their lurid, variegated doctrines. The police were
ubiquitous. By scores, even hundreds, they would attend meetings,
breaking them up and jailing leaders whenever occasion offered. The
Seiyukai party hired bands of <i>soshi</i>, professional ruffians, to raise
disturbances at these gatherings, and free fights and broken heads
became commonplace. Still, the various movements gathered force, came
together in common interest as streamlets flow together and form a
river. The many feeble unions joined hands, formed federations. Where
heretofore strikes had been mainly isolated, men in this shop or
factory striking solely in the interests of their own purely personal
concerns, demanding discharge of unpopular foremen, shorter hours,
higher pay, they now amalgamated and struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> together, the entire body
of workers of one industry, striking in sympathy with other unions.
The dockyard workers went out because the employers would not pay a
full year's salary to discharged workmen; the seamen threatened to
follow suit unless the demand were granted, and the employers gave in.
Capital became frightened, tried to stave off the evil day by paying
ever greater allowances, hoping desperately to soothe the clamor by
doles of money; but the situation had gone beyond this. The day of the
old feudal relation between master and workman, the personal touch of
a feeling of common interest, had passed. As if born over-night, class
consciousness loomed forth, overshadowed the entire situation. Demands
for higher pay, shorter hours, became subordinated, fell into the
background; now the cry was for a share by the workmen in control of
industries, abolition of capitalism.</p>

<p>It became almost impossible to segregate fact from fiction. One could
not know what might have happened. It was impracticable to depend on
the reports of the press; one knew that the most important news was
not allowed to see the light of day. Kent tried to get what he could
from original sources. What was capital thinking of all this; what was
it doing about it? He sought bankers and industrial leaders. They all
professed that there was no cause for great worry, brought forth sheafs
of statistics compiled by various government offices and capital-labor
harmony societies, trying to console themselves with patently absurd
figures proving that there was no unemployment, that more men were
given work than lost employment, that all was serene. Ostrich-like they
buried their heads in the convenient mess of figures, insistent on not
seeing the truth.</p>

<p>"It's only a phase of the depression which we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> passing through just
like other countries," they insisted. "Things are no worse here than
they were in America and Europe a few decades ago when your workmen
were in a similar condition. Remember, we have in a few years almost
caught up industrially with the countries which were several centuries
ahead of us. Give us a few years more and conditions here will be the
same. Anyway, the situation here is not as bad as in the United States
and England, for example. Our strikes are insignificant in comparison.
We have never had business held up for weeks and months by nation-wide
strikes. In New York and Chicago you have daylight bank robberies and
hold-ups. In Japan a man may walk safely anywhere with a roll of bank
notes in his hand, even in the poorest quarters. And the industrial
workers are too few in proportion to the total of population to count
for much; only they make lots of noise. The bulk of the people is
agricultural. There's nothing very much to worry about."</p>

<p>He pointed out that danger lay in the fact that the agricultural
population also had become infected with resentment against capital.
Thousands of unions of tenant farmers, who constitute half of the
agriculturists, had been formed and clamored against the exactions of
rapacious landlords. Some of them had made united demands for rent
reduction, had refused to till the soil when such were not granted,
and had proclaimed that if other tenants were brought in to cultivate
the land, these men would be ostracized; so the fields now lay idle.
What about the formation of the gigantic federation of farmers' unions
and its great convention in Kobe? What about the report that soldiers
who had served their term in the army in Siberia were sowing the seeds
of Bolshevism throughout the peasantry? Did not that show that the
farmers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> were likely to make common cause with the industrial workers?</p>

<p>But they remained stubbornly sanguine here also. This, too, was only
a phase. A general of the Siberian expedition had said that this
Bolshevism was only on the surface, like face powder, which would
speedily wash off. So that was that, so to speak. Presently there would
be a big rice crop; there were all indications of a bumper yield, and
then the farmers would be happy again, and quiet. Anyway, capital was
doing what it could. A horde of scholars and statisticians was studying
the situation, and obviously it would be unwise to move in the dark,
until these experts had reported. And the Government had appointed a
commission for studying the problem of universal suffrage, which would
report some day. It was a grave question whether the masses were ripe
for the vote. It would not do to be over-hasty.</p>

<p>The task of obtaining reliable data with respect to the other side of
the situation was equally baffling. A woman Socialist had sprung into
fame through her articles in various magazines advocating the cause of
the masses; partly, also, from the fact that her husband, a university
professor, had been placed in jail. Kent went to see her in her small
house crammed from floor to ceiling with books and pamphlets, the
inevitable Karl Marx tomes looming forth with glorious prominence.
She hailed him with joy, chanted a tirade of almost unbelievable
accusations; the capitalists were holding the workers&mdash;men, women, and
even children&mdash;in slavery. Many of them were kept far underground in
mines and were not allowed to see light of day for months; they tried
purposely to kill them by means of unwholesome food and unsanitary
quarters in order to prevent them from going back to the country
districts and spreading the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> Socialism. It was easy to get
young men and girls to replace them, owing to the general unemployment.
But he wanted something more definite, data, figures. Certainly, he
should have them. She would send him such in a few days. She sent him
a vast bundle of papers, a mass of laboriously contrived compilations
of figures, going back into the early days of Japanese industrialism,
showing by minutely detailed statistics that one-half of the factory
work women died from consumption within two years of employment in
the great textile mills. It seemed almost incredible, and as he went
into the matter he found that figures had been given for periods
before the time when vital statistics of any kind had been kept by
the Government or any one else; still closer examination showed that
the tables did not check, were wildly contradictory in many cases.
Evidently the author had drawn her data, enthusiastically, from her
inner consciousness. He went back to her, told her that her information
must be more consistent, more reliable. She tore the bundle from his
hands. A few days later one of the vernacular papers published a lurid
account from her, mentioning him by name as a capitalist spy who had
been frustrated by the famous lady Socialist.</p>

<p>He called on Ikeda, the head of the federation of labor, a rotund,
pleasant-faced man with humorous eyes beaming from behind great
round spectacles. "Yes, it is getting worse all the time," said the
leader. "Of course, all this helps to bring the unions together,
but it is difficult to keep them in hand. We all want abolition of
capitalism, but while some of us want it accomplished peacefully, by
evolution, many of the workers, most of the smaller unions especially,
want nothing short of revolution. They are Sovietists, Communists,
Syndicalists, Anarchists, all kinds. They are getting more and more out
of hand." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would universal suffrage content them any?" asked Kent. "I should
think if you centered on the suffrage movement, gave them that to think
about, you might maintain control. Anyway, it seems to me that labor
must remain powerless as long as it is voiceless and has no control in
the government. I take it that you people will back up the universal
suffrage agitation at the next session of the Diet?"</p>

<p>The eyes behind the great lenses became serious. "No, we're going to
leave it alone. In fact, we dare not take it up. The workmen look upon
that as futile, a mere sop, a process that's altogether too slow to
suit them. We're afraid that if we took up suffrage as an organized
movement, the unions would get out of hand; it would set them thinking
of more revolutionary measures; they would insist on them and would
sweep aside us who are trying to lead them along a constructive line
of action. Anyway, the masses are hardly ripe for suffrage yet. They
must be educated first; that's what we are trying to do now, to educate
them."</p>

<p>So here, too, was temporizing. Labor leaders, like capitalist leaders,
were trying to play for time, to avoid facing the music, while the
steam in the kettle kept becoming denser and stronger, with ever more
insistent force striving against the walls of repression. But how
much was there really behind all this clamor of labor? He came to
wonder to what extent these complaints were justified. It was true,
what the capitalists said, that conditions in Japan were no worse, or
not much worse, than they had been in America and Europe not so many
decades ago. Of course, the unrest was due to the fact that workers and
farmers, heretofore satisfied with feudal conditions not knowing that
they could be otherwise, had suddenly been shown by the Socialists, the
soldiers coming back from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> Siberia, the radical press, that workmen
in other countries lived in what seemed to frugal Japanese eyes the
luxury of millionaires, and now they wanted similar privileges, yes,
rights. But capital was right in its contention that workers who
could individually bring forth only one-fifth the result produced by
the white workmen could be paid wages only in proportion to their
output capacity&mdash;otherwise Japanese production cost would rise to the
point where Japanese goods would be helpless in world competition and
industry must cease. The point seemed to be whether capital was holding
down labor to unduly harsh conditions.</p>

<p>He took to rambling about in the poorer quarters of Tokyo, but could
learn but little. The houses were frail, of thin boards and paper,
but so were those of the wealthier classes; it was the form of
construction adopted by a hardy people. Even if these buildings were
dirtier, dingier, the population showed no sign of abject poverty,
of misery. Children played merrily in the streets; men and women
moved about or sat chatting in the open stores. A Japanese might have
learned something, might have penetrated more intimately into their
lives, might have entered their dwellings, have drawn from them their
confidential thoughts, but as a foreigner he felt himself baffled
by an invisible veil of reserve. They were courteous, friendly, but
impenetrable. Only occasionally might he detect a hostile, wondering
glance&mdash;what might this foreigner be doing in such places&mdash;or he might
hear childish voices behind his back uplifted in song to the effect
that the foreigner's father was a cat. One night a couple of fellows
mellowed by sake wanted to take him to their bosom, tried to embrace
him, overcome by all-enfolding love of mankind generally, insisted on
his joining them in their festive circumambulations. It was annoying.
They were harder to deal with than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> if they had been unpleasant. He
was trying to hold them off, irritated at the laughing crowd that had
gathered, to escape, in some way. Suddenly the ranks of the onlookers
parted and a Japanese in foreign clothes strode through, a middle-aged
man, muscular, authoritative. "Here, you fellows, run along; can't
you see that this foreigner wishes to pass?" The men stood back
shamefacedly, murmured some apology. "All right, now run along." He
cleared a way through the crowd. "They mean well enough," he explained
to Kent, "but probably you had better let me go with you for a moment."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right. Still, I want to thank you for your help." He began
to explain why he had come; it was only due this unknown rescuer, and
then the man had spoken in English, and evidently held some authority
that the people here recognized. Who might he be, anyway?</p>

<p>"So you come to see poverty," the man laughed. "Well, if you really
want to see it, the real thing, I think you may find no better man
to guide you. That's my specialty, you see." He went on to explain.
He was an official, it appeared, had charge of a government home for
unemployed, where men might sleep for fifteen sen a night and board
for forty sen a day. "But there are too few of these places," he
complained. "We can take care of less than one tenth of the thousands
who need it. There are no free sleeping places, no free food. The
Capital-Harmony Society has provided a few reading rooms, playgrounds
and all that; every now and then some rich man gives a small park; but
they all give a few hundred thousands where they ought to be giving in
millions. They can't see that if they don't give now, freely, these
people will come some day and take it from them by force. If you care
to come along, I'll show you how these people live." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>He led Kent through a maze of narrow alleys, into the Fukagawa quarter,
through dark lanes illumined only by faint light from open doorways.
They must walk warily over rotten boards covering the slimy gutters
which served as sewers, to avoid the deepest of the universal mud.
Presently they came to a collection of buildings more squalid than the
rest,&mdash;long, barn-like houses of filthy, rotting wood.</p>

<p>"Here you are," said the guide. "These are the 'Nagaya Tunnels'; they
are famous for being the worst place in the city."</p>

<p>They entered. Through the length of the building ran a narrow passage,
faced on both sides by cubicles of three mats each, spaces of six
by nine feet, each housing a family, several adults and swarms of
children. In the passageway all cooking and washing was done. It was
cluttered with <i>hibachi</i>, firewood, cooking utensils, buckets for
water brought from a pump outside, heterogeneous implements. Women
were busy cooking, and acrid smoke ascended idly against the roof,
escaping through a large hole and numerous cracks and crevices. As
they passed down this corridor they could look into the minute rooms,
packed with goods, ragged <i>futon</i>, tattered clothing, poor belongings
of every kind, leaving only a scant space in the middle where humans
sat huddled together or lay asleep. Some of the rooms, particularly
those where a few men maintained slovenly bachelor housekeeping,
were ill-kept, with paper hanging in streamers from broken <i>shoji</i>
ribs, and goods scattered about haphazardly. Others formed striking
contrast with desperate attempts at cleanliness, where woman hands
had tried pathetically to create some kind of home atmosphere in the
box-like spaces allotted them in this turmoil of poverty. Kent caught
a glimpse of a family seated about a low Japanese table, father,
mother and a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> of children, sitting decorously, with the same
display of graceful manners as might be seen in the abodes of the rich,
daintily picking with their chopsticks fish and vegetables from cheap
earthenware. A tiny glass globe with a couple of goldfish was suspended
from the window frame. The little tableau was like a ray of light in
the mass of grime and poverty all about it, a pitiable insistence
on maintenance of the spirit of family life, of decency despite the
squalor hemming it in on all sides.</p>

<p>As they fumbled on, some of the inhabitants recognized the guide,
crowded up to him with tales of their troubles. These were men only;
the women eyed them curiously, dully, but remained apathetic. From
the shadows unkempt wretches emerged. An old fellow with only one eye
insisted on removing his bandage. He had lost his eye in an accident
while working for the municipal electric light works; but they had
given him nothing. Now, he had been trying to peddle small fish, but
they had stopped him because he had no license. Where could he get
money for a license? He had nothing to eat; others could find no
employment. They wanted assistance, money, jobs.</p>

<p>But, oddly, try as he might, Kent could not draw even from the
all-surrounding evidences of abject poverty an impression of suffering,
of heart-rending misery. It was revolting that here several hundreds
of humans were forced to find shelter in these miserable hovels,
collections of rotten wood worth probably less than a thousand yen as
kindling and fit for nothing else. But while presence of Americans or
Europeans in such quarters would have caused him indignation, intense
sympathy, here these people, inured to hardship by generation after
generation of Spartan frugality, possessed a happy faculty of making
the best of these wretched circumstances, of accepting them stoically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Mingled with the complaints, the stories of distress, had been laughter
of children, the glimpse of the family at table, triumphantly wringing
content from even such mean material. He was annoyed that he should
feel like this, essentially unsympathetic, unable to register the
distress which the plight of these people should produce; but the fact
was that there seemed to be no anguish, no grinding, torturing grief.</p>

<p>He mentioned it to his companion. "It seems strange to me; here is
poverty, and squalor and even want, and yet most of these people do not
seem to be altogether unhappy; some even seem fairly well satisfied."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true, but, as a matter of fact, you've come at the wrong
time. Yesterday was the first of the month, and those of them who had
jobs got their pay, and even those without jobs benefit from that.
Those who have money share with the rest. But you ought to have been
here last month, during the rains. I was down here trying to help,
and the water came up to my armpits, tide and rain water mixed. The
whole district was flooded, and the houses. In the single-story ones
like the Tunnels the water stood several feet over the floors and the
people had to construct makeshift shelves for themselves and their
belongings. There they sat for several days, wet, hungry, cold. I've
heard the cry of little children for food and their mothers trying to
hush them, explaining that the father could not work during the flood.
And that sort of thing is not unusual; it happens several times a
year, as often as half a dozen times, whenever there is a heavy rain.
This entire quarter is not fit for human habitation, but the factories
have been built here because the location is convenient and the land
comparatively cheap; and the workers must live near the factories.
The whole district should be filled, but these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> people have no voice
in the government. Only the rich can vote for city councilmen, and
the government funds are spent for the benefit of the rich, in wide
avenues in the fine residence districts, by hundreds of thousands for
celebrations&mdash;but there is no money for rescuing the poor from the
floods.</p>

<p>"And do you know that the odd thing is that it's these very same poor
people who are carrying the burden of maintaining the city. Tokyo
collects less than four million yen a year from land and house taxes,
and yet she is the sixth largest city in the world. The revenue is
collected by indirect taxation, by the huge profits of the car system,
by the imposts and stamp duties and licenses for every conceivable
thing. The proportion of business tax paid by the magnates is
infinitesimally small when compared with that wrung from the peddlers
and small shopkeepers. So you see, the poor wretches who must cling
to their walls like bats while the flood waters sweep over their
floors, are at the same time paying for the boulevards and improving
the property whose owners contribute almost nothing. Until a few years
ago they did not think of that; they didn't know that things could
be different. But now they're being taught, and they're beginning to
figure things out. This is the kind of a place that breeds 'dangerous
thoughts,' and, I tell you, when I am down here during flood time, I
come pretty close to having 'dangerous thoughts' myself."</p>

<p>A few days later Kent was telling of this experience to a group of
friends, Japanese and foreign, chance-met at the Imperial Hotel bar.
"It's damnable. Of course, in every country we have rich rolling in
luxury and poor ones groaning in misery, but in no place is the gulf
between the classes so great, and nowhere else are the plutocrats
so utterly unfeeling, so heartless; in no place are the poor ground
so hard to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> such absurdly high profits, your sixty and seventy
per cent. dividends, your constant subsidies to giant companies and
industries, your tariffs for protection of profiteers. I tell you, when
I was mucking about down there in Fukagawa and heard of what it was
like during the rains, and what it will continue to be like, I felt
that I should like to meet these people, the Watanabes, the Inouyes,
the Yamanakas, the Oharas, the lady with the blood-dyed silken shift of
the song, you know, and I should like to kick the whole damned outfit,
yes, the lady, too, by the gods."</p>

<p>"Look out, Kent, you're getting 'dangerous thoughts.'" They laughed and
dismissed the subject, but one of them, Hata, leaned across the table
to Kent.</p>

<p>"You know, Kent-san, I don't think you'd want to kick them at all, if
you met them. In fact, you'd like them. I'll bet you a tiffin on it."</p>

<p>"All right, you're on," he replied thoughtlessly. The others had taken
up the question of the Chinese demand for the return of the Liaotung
peninsula, and he was interested.</p>

<p>A few days later Hata appeared at his office. "I have an invitation for
you, you and your friend, Mr. Karsten, to have luncheon with Baron and
Baroness Ohara, almost any day that would suit you. Would next Friday
do? You know," he had noted the surprise on Kent's face, "you said
you'd like to meet them."</p>

<p>Could ever such an absurd situation occur outside of Japan? How the
devil could he accept the hospitality of people whom he had said he
would like to kick, the Baroness at that? And still he was greatly
tempted to grasp this opportunity to see at first hand, in their
intimate home surroundings, these people, these heartless plutocrats
who ground down the poor that they might amass wealth in a measure far
greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> than they could possibly use by even the most extravagant
luxury. He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Did you by any chance say anything to the Oharas about my desire to
kick them, Hata-san? Of course, you see that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, of course, not," he interrupted eagerly. "You know, I'm fairly
close to Baron Ohara, and I really wanted you to meet him and the
Baroness. They are charming people; you'll revise your opinion. I've
told them of your investigation of the conditions of the poor in Tokyo,
and they are much interested and really want you to tell them about it
all. Anyway, do you think it would be fair for you to see only one side
and then condemn the other? How about Friday?"</p>

<p>Kent accepted. What an odd proposition. Of course, Hata was right
enough; he must seek both sides before passing judgment; but what the
devil interest might Hata have in this? He did not know much about him,
a suave, frock-coated gentleman, highly intelligent, fluent in English
and French, ubiquitous in all places where Japanese and foreigners
intermingled. He was known to be more or less definitely connected with
the big interests&mdash;some even claimed that he was obscurely identified
with the Foreign Office&mdash;but he was clever, an excellent companion,
always ready to be of service in giving information or obtaining it
for the foreigners. They accepted him as a sort of unofficial liaison
officer maintained by the Japanese for the purpose of keeping them
informed as to what the foreigners thought; also, in some measure, to
elucidate the Japanese point of view. He was a bit of a mystery, but a
pleasant one.</p>

<p>On the appointed day Hata came to escort them in one of the Baron's
automobiles. "Here we are; this is the place," he pointed with almost
proprietary pride to a long brick wall rising well above the height
of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> tall man's head, hiding from view whatever might be enclosed
within. "How do you like that gate?" Liveried commissionaires held
open the massive iron-grille work, flanked on each side by tower-like
buttresses. "The Baron had it brought from France; it's an exact copy
of that of some château somewhere there."</p>

<p>"Frankly, I'd rather have seen in its place one of those great wooden,
brass-studded gates of old Japan," said Karsten. "Wouldn't you, Kent?"
But Kent did not answer. He recalled a picture he had seen in the
Japanese papers, some months ago, of this very gate, closed, with
a score of women clamoring, gesticulating through its ornate bars,
workers who had vainly tried to bring their complaints direct to the
owner of the factories in which they were employed. Eventually they had
been hustled away by the police.</p>

<p>The automobile swept round a miniature mountain cleverly built up from
carefully placed rocks. Trees had been planted amongst them; vines
sprang from the interstices; skillful hands had laboriously contrived
to reproduce a picture of untouched, untrammeled nature, an atmosphere
of the free and restful mountainous country that made it difficult to
realize that the grimy tangles of the city were but a hundred yards
behind.</p>

<p>More liveried servants met them at the door of the mansion, a large
modern thing, but well planned, with the quiet air of great wealth
which disdainfully avoided garishness. The Baron met them in the hall,
a young man&mdash;Kent judged him to be about thirty-five&mdash;slim, seeming
tall with his trim athletic figure, almost like some young French
aristocrat as is a type which recent years has brought forth among
the wealthy classes of Japan. He was graceful, pleasantly placing
them at ease. Harvard, then Cambridge, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> obliterated the stamp of
race; it did not enter one's thought; one felt exactly as if he might
have been a young Frenchman, Italian, Spaniard. He led them into an
immense living room, high-ceilinged, with French windows giving on
to an Italian garden which had been laid out behind the house. This
also was entirely modern, with the same atmosphere of wealth carefully
restrained by unfailing taste, excellently chosen furnishings, each
thing of value and elegance, but harmonious, with an air of comfort, of
a delightful living place. Possibly a hint of excess, over-crowding,
might be conveyed by the superabundance of paintings which covered
the walls everywhere. At first glance the display seemed too lavish,
garish even, but this soon wore away as one came to look more closely,
appreciating the beauty of each individual piece. Here was a gallery
of modern art with here and there an almost priceless thing by some
old master, and one sensed that this profusion was due, not merely to
a desire for display, but to a genuine affection for these pictures, a
real wish to have them ever before the eye.</p>

<p>Karsten became enthusiastic immediately, could not keep away from the
paintings. In a moment he and the Baron had become as if they were old
friends, passing from one thing to the other, appraising, commenting,
sharing enthusiasm. Even Kent became absorbed. A discreet clearing of
the throat from Hata recalled them. "Baroness Ohara."</p>

<p>In this atmosphere of modern Europe she seemed almost out of place as
she came up slowly, with tripping gait in her soft <i>zori</i>, absolutely
Japanese in her garb of soft, neutral-hued kimono silks and great obi
band; only the coiffure showed some concession to the modern, the hair,
free from the oil of conventional hairdressing, being arranged in its
natural softness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> into a wavy crown hiding part of the forehead and
protruding over the ears.</p>

<p>The Baron made the introductions and she bowed deeply, gravely,
extending her welcome to the guests in the polished refinement of
Japanese phrase.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing you speak Japanese," commented the Baron to Karsten
and Kent. "My wife speaks only Japanese. She has never been abroad."
So for a moment the commonplaces were exchanged in Japanese, but soon
he and Karsten were back at the pictures again. Two other guests,
Japanese, joined them. One of these spoke French as his only foreign
language. The conversation became polyglot, as they conversed in
English or French about the pictures, or in Japanese with the Baroness.
Kent was asked to take her in to luncheon.</p>

<p>At table, also, everything was in European style. It was with
difficulty that Kent could compel himself to realize that here he was
really in Japan; he could succeed only by glancing at the pretty,
dainty figure at his side, listening to her soft, melodious Japanese.
At the beginning the talk concerned itself about the poor quarters.
Kent tried to describe what he had seen. They were all interested,
receptive; but somehow he felt that he was not speaking well, that he
was failing entirely to convey the picture, the sensations which he had
felt; he could not drive himself into the vein in these surroundings.
He tried to conjure before his mind the miserable realities of the
"Tunnels," to revive the sense of indignation caused by contrast of
the misery there and the luxury here, at the unfeelingness of these
plutocrats whose most trifling bit of ornament was worth many times the
value of the Tunnel shacks and all they contained. But he could not
make himself despise these people, or hate them. He caught a glance
from Hata. Was he thinking of his expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> wish to kick them, this
graceful, petite incarnation of charm who was sitting right next to
him, eyes wide with interest as if he were telling of matters of a
distant country, things which were far from her, which had not the
least direct concern with her. The thought confused him. He felt with
irritation that his talk was unconvincing, featureless, lame. He was
glad when the interest of Karsten in the pictures brought the main
drift of the conversation to that subject. The talk became general,
the Baron and Karsten leading. When they left the table, they returned
to examination of the pictures, followed them down along the walls,
Karsten and the Japanese, into the hallway beyond. Presently Kent found
himself alone with the Baroness.</p>

<p>"Tell me some more about these poor people," she asked. "You know, they
came here once, a lot of poor women, and wanted to talk to my husband.
But he was not here. I crept outside and hid in the shrubbery so I
could watch them. They were standing there by the gate and stretching
their arms in through the iron grilles. I felt so sorry for them. I
wanted to go and talk to them, to have them come in here and talk to
me; but I was afraid. I know nothing about business. They might not
have liked it, the men in charge of the business. I was afraid of them,
these grave, old men who are in charge of the factories and the mines
and all that. I was more afraid of them than of my husband. He knows so
little of the business, too, you know."</p>

<p>So this was the lady whose silken shift was dyed crimson with blood
from working girls' fingers. He wondered if she knew the song; probably
not; she lived as if she were thousands of miles removed from the grim
sordidness whence was evolved almost miraculously all this wealth of
beauty and art. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> as he began to tell her about it, it seemed so
futile, so incongruous, like trying to contaminate the frail fairness
of a hothouse orchid with thought of the grimy coal mines which
furnished fuel for the heat which gave it life. He could understand how
it was possible for these people, the plutocrats, to be innocent of
realization of the meanness of the sources of their wealth. Again he
wanted to get away from the subject.</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful garden," he stepped up to a window. "I admire the
artistry with which it has been fashioned. Here you can see but a bit
of Italy. You would never know that Tokyo is right beyond."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you like it. That is my great interest, the gardens,"
she was quite radiant. "And beyond that, below the terrace, we have a
typical Japanese garden, just like real, old Japan. You must see it
some time. I'm often quite lonesome, you know. Some day, when you are
not too busy, you must come and have tea with me, and I will show you
all the gardens."</p>

<p>She went on, telling of the plans for an artificial waterfall, run by
an invisible electric pump, which she was having constructed; about the
chrysanthemums which she was nurturing carefully for exhibition at the
great November show at Hibiya. He enjoyed her, just like that, with
her natural, ingenuous concern with beauty of flowers, the congruous
interest of a gentlewoman of Japan. And as she went on, with bright
eyes and soft voice, and the picture flashed into his mind of the
women, hard-voiced, stridently storming at the gate, the conviction
came to him that should this occur while he was here, were they to
come this moment, he would do what he could to keep this dainty, pure,
flower-like little woman away, removed from the grim realities which
must not be suffered to enter disturbingly into the serenity of her
existence. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you didn't kick the Baroness while we weren't looking, did you?"
chaffed Karsten, as they were on their way home.</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Karsten," it irritated gratingly. "I know well enough
when I've made a fool of myself. You needn't rub it in." They went on
a while in silence. "Still, you know, Karsten, I can't help feeling
that I might have made better use of my opportunity to do something
for those poor devils out in Fukagawa. I feel sure that had I been
able to be more convincing, to make them feel as I felt when I was
there, as I feel now, as a matter of fact, I might have contrived to do
something to help. These people, the Oharas, are decent enough, kind
enough, would surely give gladly from their wealth. Here they spend
on a picture more than a hundred of what those poor devils earn in a
year. It isn't right. Of course, it's because they don't know; but they
<i>should</i> know, at least Ohara should. It's an obligation of wealth;
only he doesn't think of it."</p>

<p>"But he does, in a fashion, at least," Karsten interrupted him. "He
was talking to me about it, out there in the hall. He wants to do
something; he would like to give, but he doesn't know how to go about
it. He tells me that he has spoken to his directors, but they tell
him that he must not interfere with business, that his ill-advised
attempts would do more harm than good, and the constant attempts at
blackmail to which he is exposed, like the rest of the millionaires,
do not particularly encourage him to inject himself into the whirl
of business. And, you know, if I were in his place, I think I should
do exactly as he does, spend my time collecting pictures, building
gardens, adding to the beauty of the city, with shooting and golf as
side issues. I should be content, as he is, to leave my business in
the hands of those who have far better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> qualifications to conduct it,
technical training and all that. Anyway, Ohara has the satisfaction
of knowing that his concerns are leading the way for improvement. You
know, some of them are spoken of as 'model' factories."</p>

<p>Kent did not answer, only shrugged his shoulders. Yes, "model
factories"!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>Gradually life became smoothed into the old routine existence. News
seemed to occur sporadically in cycles, like the apexes and depressions
of a chart; at times the vernacular press would be filled with accounts
of disturbing events, strikes, mass meetings of workmen, of Socialists
demanding this or that, establishment of shop committees in factories,
recognition of the Soviet government; reports of arrests and police
dispersing gatherings; and this would be followed by hiatus-like
intervals when it seemed almost as if all these things had been
forgotten, as if the excitement had outworn itself. Kent found himself
going often to the dances at Tsurumi; there was little else to do. He
began to find Tokyo dull.</p>

<p>He was sitting with Karsten one evening in the study upstairs, talking
idly of this and that. It was late; the brilliant glitter of the
<i>machiai</i> below was gradually fading. Some one in the entrance hall
was talking with Jun-san; they could hear the faint murmur of voices.
Suddenly Jun-san appeared.</p>

<p>"Kent-san," wide-open eyes showed surprise, bewildered wonder. "A young
lady has come to see you, Suzuki Kimiko-san. She says she must see you.
What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged! Just wait a moment, Jun-san." He turned to
Karsten, met only his ironic smile as he blew great smoke clouds
luxuriously against the ceiling. "Damn it, Karsten, don't sit there
like an ass. I haven't the slightest idea what that girl has come
here for. I have been with her often at Tsurumi and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> at hotel dances,
you know, but, by the gods, there isn't the slightest reason why she
should come here, a girl of her class, at this time of the night, a
<i>go-fujin</i>, a lady. Why it's even more serious in Japan than it would
be at home."</p>

<p>"Seems to me the only thing you can do is to ask her up here. You can't
in decency let her stand there in the hall. Ask Suzuki-san to come up,
Jun-san. Kent, you've got to find out what is the trouble, anyway. By
Cæsar, for a man of your continent tastes, you seem to have more than
your share of exciting episodes with women."</p>

<p>They could hear the exchange of the usual ritual of polite phrases
between the women as they were mounting the stairs. "Please enter."
Jun-san drew the partition aside.</p>

<p>Kimiko stood in the doorway, hands nervously clenched, quivering a
little, lips trembling as she spoke, words issuing haltingly in short
breaths. "Kent-san. I've come to you. I've run away."</p>

<p>"You've run away." He had risen to meet her; stood dumbly gazing at her
as if she had suddenly dropped from the ceiling. She had run away! It
seemed as if his brain could grapple with just that one idea, that he
could not get beyond it.</p>

<p>"Sit down please, Suzuki-san," Karsten came to the rescue. "Jun-san,
will you please have some tea brought. Get to your senses, Kent. We
must do what we can to assist this young lady. Here, let me take your
wraps, Suzuki-san," he took them, pressed her gently into a chair,
bustled about to give Kent time to collect himself.</p>

<p>But Kent was still bewildered. "So you have run away. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a long story. I'll tell you presently, to-morrow; only find
some place for me here to-night."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> She was fighting hard for control of
her voice, hands clenched tightly to the chair arms. "Only let me stay
here to-night."</p>

<p>"But what about your family? You must go home, Kimiko-san, or you'll
have all kinds of trouble. I'll see you home, little girl, and then
to-morrow you can come and tell me all about your troubles. Can't you
see that that will be better," he spoke soothingly. "I'll see you home."</p>

<p>"I can't go home. There's no one there. They have all gone to the
country. They don't know yet that I have run away."</p>

<p>That, at least, was some relief. She explained that the family had
left Tokyo a few days before, while she stayed with friends, expecting
her to join them later. "But then I heard, oh, then I heard&mdash;&mdash;" she
glanced at Karsten. He looked to Kent. Jun-san and the servants entered
with the tea things. The matter-of-fact mechanics of having tea brought
the situation down to a more natural level. "I wonder, Suzuki-san,
whether it would not be better to wait until to-morrow," suggested
Karsten. "Then you'll be less excited. We'll take care of you. What do
you think?" She nodded eagerly. In the reaction of the commonplace she
wished only to gain postponement. It was arranged that she should stay
the night in Jun-san's cottage.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Kent found himself alone with Kimiko. Karsten
and Jun-san had contrived to withdraw inconspicuously. "And now,
Kimiko-san," he drew his chair close to hers. "Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>She brought both hands up to her hair, smoothed it back slowly. "I
ran away," she spoke evenly, measuredly&mdash;evidently she had rehearsed
carefully what she intended to say&mdash;"I ran away because I heard that
they wanted me to marry Kikuchi-san." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>During the night he had puzzled the matter over and had come to the
conclusion that it must be something like that, that the family,
after the old Japanese fashion, must have decided that now that she
had reached the age when girls must marry, arrangements must be made
for contracting a suitable alliance. He had even thought that young
Kikuchi might be the one; the families were close, and the Suzuki money
might fit in well with the noble but not over-wealthy Kikuchi house.
It seemed natural enough; Kikuchi had shown that he liked the girl. He
had wondered whether this young Japanese might not resent the evident
intimacy of a foreigner with this bright, young beauty, though he had
never given sign thereof. And now, why the deuce had she come to him?
That, too, had puzzled him. Could it be that&mdash;&mdash;? No, of course, not.
Still, the thought had insisted. What if she wanted him to marry her?
The idea had had allurement. He liked her very much, could almost
contrive to believe that he might love her. But he held out against the
thought; the family would be sure to set itself against it; and even if
they should marry first and confront it with the accomplished fact, the
papers would be sure to revel in the incident, as they always did where
daughters of the aristocracy followed the unconventional. They would
make her out a decadent, wantonly abandoning the decent traditions,
would harry her into unhappiness with their hue and cry. And then he
himself; he had made up his mind that Karsten had been right, that in
spite of its allurement, marriage with a Japanese girl would not work
out in his case. He had reasoned it all out that time at Hakone. But
was that why she had come to him?</p>

<p>She seemed to read his thought. "I came to you, Kent-san, because I
could go to no Japanese. They would have been shocked, would have sent
me home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> And I wanted to talk to some one, to get away from the family
where I was. I knew that the go-between would be coming in a few days,
and I wanted to get advice first. I didn't know what to do.</p>

<p>"But why don't you want to marry Kikuchi-san? Don't you like him?" he
was sparring, trying to elicit from her something that might give a
clew.</p>

<p>"Yes, I like him, but I would never marry a Japanese like him, to be
just like these other old-fashioned Japanese married women, always
obedient, always compelled to serve him, to have to regard whatever he
might do as right, even if he had geisha sweethearts; never to have a
right to have a personality of my own."</p>

<p>"But surely Kikuchi-san is modern. I know him. Sometimes I think he's
almost radical. He takes after foreign ideas in everything. It seems to
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course, he's modern. He goes to the dances, and dresses
after the <i>haikara</i> fashions, and plays golf, and talks very advanced
politics, and all that. And in all that he is really modern, advanced,
like so many of our young men; but when it comes to marriage, to the
matter of the standing of women, he's like the rest of them, too. They
want modernism and liberalism, but only for the men. In regard to us
women their view is different; there they want to stick entirely to the
old, hidebound rules. They want the modern freedom of thought and of
action&mdash;but only for the men.</p>

<p>"But we women, we want the right to think too, to live our own lives
just as your women do. We are no more stupid, no more old-fashioned
than the men. But they are all against us, all the men. See how often
the <i>Fujin Koraon</i>, the Public Opinion of Women paper, is suppressed
by the police. But still we learn and we know. Women are going into
business and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> into politics; there are even many women Socialists, and
the police are afraid of them. And in the matter of marriage; we want
now to have a right to say whom we want to marry, to have a right to
marry&mdash;for love." She looked him straight in the eye, compelling her
glance to meet his, blushing a little, but only finger tips rubbing
restlessly against one another betraying her nervousness. "Even in
school we talked about love, yes, even free love. It is right if people
love each other, if there's no other way. <i>Shikataganai.</i> It can't
be helped then. And the principal called in Shinto priests, and had
them perform, right in the school, the 'soul-quieting ceremony,' and
eighteen of us had to assist them, all dressed in white. And we laughed
at it all. It was so silly.</p>

<p>"That is the reason why you hear about the Clover Leaf Club, which
receives letters from men and women who want to marry, and the officers
sort them out and bring together the couples which they think are well
matched. That's why you see sometimes in the newspapers advertisements
for husbands, occasionally even for foreign husbands," she laughed
demurely. "Oh, that's silly, I know, but still it all shows how we
feel. And that's how I feel. I don't want to marry, at least, not now;
but if I ever do, I shall want to make my own choice, and I shall
surely choose a man who believes as I do.</p>

<p>"That's the trouble in Japan, if a girl grows a few years older than
twenty, the family consider that it is a disgrace if she doesn't marry.
That is why they are beginning to worry about me, especially as they
have had to give it up about my sister; but then they think that in
her case it is the fault of the schooling she received abroad. So now
they are doubly anxious on my account; they don't want two old maids
well over twenty in the family. But now that I have run away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> that
would be an even worse scandal. The papers would play it up as they did
the countess who tried to commit double suicide with a chauffeur, or
as they did with Akiko-san, the millionaire's wife who ran away with
a poet. You know, I have been in the papers once already. That was
when they were making such a fuss about Japanese girls dancing foreign
fashion, and some of them even published the names of girls who went to
dances. One of them mentioned my name, and my parents were so angry.
Now, if they don't leave me alone, I won't go home, and the papers
will learn about my having run away, and that will be worse than ever,
especially because I have run away to a foreigner."</p>

<p>She leaned back, crossed one knee over the other, looked at him
expectantly. She had gained her composure entirely, even enjoyed the
situation, now that the difficult part, the telling, was done with.
She evidently anticipated approval from him, praise of her cleverness.
But the revelation of her motive in coming to him was like a douche
of cold water. Of course, he ought to be pleased. What he had taken
to be the unfolding of a melodrama, tragedy possibly, developing
slowly, ominously, towards an inescapable woeful climax, had suddenly
grotesquely become transformed into a droll burlesque, fantastic but
harmless. But the suddenness of the metamorphosis irritated him, the
sense of finding himself taking a rôle in farce where he had, gravely,
been preparing himself for pathos. So all his vain imaginings that she
might have sought him out because of affection on her part, because
of her having greater confidence in him, was mere fancy. The little
minx was using him merely as a convenient lay figure where a moment
before he had thought himself to be cast in a principal rôle. What an
anti-climax! </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"And now that you have planned it all out so well, what do you propose
to do now? What do you expect me to do?"</p>

<p>She caught the irony in his voice. "Now, please, Kent-san, don't be
angry. I thought you would be pleased when I got it all arranged so
nicely. I thought it all out last night. You wouldn't really want me to
run away to you, with you, would you now?"</p>

<p>Was she in earnest? Was the serious note that had crept into her
voice, the appeal vaguely to be sensed therein, something more than
mere anxiety to dispel his displeasure with her stratagem? How much
did she think of him, or how little? It seemed as if he might detect
the faintest undertone of earnestness under the words rippling from
her lips, a hint of dark shadow deep in her eyes. For a moment the
temptation to grasp her hands, to draw her to him, to learn just what
was passing in her mind, gripped him; but instantly came the other
thought,&mdash;what if she should be in earnest? He shook himself together;
he had been on the brink of taking a chance which might have been
replete with fateful potentialities. Steady!</p>

<p>"No such luck, of course." Purposely he spoke lightly, banteringly. The
moment had passed safely; still, curiosity piqued him and he knew it
would continue to do so&mdash;now that he would never know.</p>

<p>"You know, I think the very best thing would be to have a talk with
your sister." The only thing for him to do now was to get this tangle
straightened as soon and as neatly as possible. "She could fix it up
for you with your parents. Do you think you can get her here to-day if
you send a telegram?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it's only a couple of hours by train." She adopted the
suggestion easily, seemed almost to have lost interest. It was arranged
that Kent should return to the house that afternoon that council might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
be held between him and the sisters. The entire episode was becoming
flat and prosaic.</p>

<p>On his way to the office he wondered whether he had better look up
Kikuchi. They were intimate; had he been an American he should surely
have sought a frank discussion of the whole affair. He was sure that
Kikuchi would be able to give the advice which he felt he needed as
he stumbled fumblingly into this maze of Oriental convention and
custom, prescriptive usages governed by modes of thought crystallized
by centuries of observance, at which he might but conjecture vaguely.
But as he thought of how he might venture to approach the subject,
it seemed too amazingly difficult, too delicate a matter to attack
hampered by uncertainty as to the reactions which might be caused in
the Oriental mind.</p>

<p>So he gave it up, decided to give the whole affair no more thought
until the afternoon, and flung open the door to the office determined
to devote himself entirely to whatever routine the day might bring.
There was Kikuchi, sitting lazily, feet against a table. It was almost
uncanny, as if by mere thought, summoned by a wish, he had materialized
like a genii of some kind.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged. You know, I had just been thinking of you,
Kikuchi-san. By Jove, you're just the man I wanted to see." Now, that
was just what he should not have said; in his surprise the words had
slipped from him. Well, anyway, now he would wait and see what the
other might have to say.</p>

<p>"I thought so; so you see, I'm here." He advanced, hand outstretched,
smiling. "No use beating about the bush, is there? It's about your
charming little visitor, Kimiko-san, is it not?"</p>

<p>Confound him, how did he know? Of course, it was generally accepted
that the authorities kept <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>themselves fairly well informed as to the
doings of foreigners, especially correspondents and such, but this was
just a little too surprising, too damnably efficient.</p>

<p>"Never mind," Kikuchi had caught his thought. "I found out about it
quite accidentally. It's all right. There will be no scandal; it won't
get out. But I had an idea that I might be concerned in this, you know,
so I just came to see you to find out; that is, if you will tell me?"</p>

<p>Well, why not? He had hesitated about seeing Kikuchi, but here fate
had solved the question for him. He filled his pipe deliberately,
spoke slowly, felt his way, gave but a bare outline. Kimiko had run
away because she feared a marriage was being arranged for her. She did
not want to marry at all. He emphasized the unimportance of his own
appearance in the drama, as a mere incidental figure, convenient as a
basis for the threat of potential scandal which formed the kernel of
Kimiko's scheme.</p>

<p>"You don't flatter yourself, do you," Kikuchi laughed. "Well, neither
do I, for, of course, you needn't have been so studiously delicate in
leaving out the fact that I am the unwelcome bridegroom&mdash;for I take
it that she told you. But it all suits me splendidly. I don't want to
marry her any more than she wants to marry me, and her scheme should
work out fine for both of us. But we'll have to move quickly lest
there be a scandal in earnest. That sort of thing won't remain secret
forever."</p>

<p>He leaned back, fingers drumming a rat-tat-tat on the chair arm,
evidently entirely content. "Why so serious, Kent-san. What are you
thinking? Here, out with it."</p>

<p>"Well, since you yourself invite it, I don't mind telling you that you
puzzle me, you two, you and Kimiko-san." He was glad that the other had
given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> him the opportunity. "You seem to me made for each other, both
young, having the same tastes, liberal thoughts, modern mode of living;
and you seem to like each other, quite evidently so; and yet, when it
comes to marriage, you both fight shy. You know, to me, to the foreign
point of view, the whole thing is, to tell the truth, mighty puzzling."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," Kikuchi laughed. "You've missed the main point
entirely; but she didn't, Kimiko-san. She knew well enough. Kent-san,
old man, you're quite right about my liking Kimiko-san. In fact, it's
more than probable that I like her far more than I shall care for
whatever girl I eventually marry. But the point is that I don't want
a modern wife, after modern style, with love, woman's rights, modern
female thoughts and all that. Will you let me be entirely frank,
Kent-san. All right; then I'll tell you just how I and many others
look at it. The point is that Japan has attained great gains from
Western civilization, electricity, steamships, railroads, and thousands
of other things that make life more pleasant and convenient; but,
honestly now, can you show me where we have gained much culturally,
or spiritually, or morally? Of course, some foreigners point to
Christianity, but you know as well as I do that much of that is
entirely on the surface. The better classes become Christians because
it is modern, just as they might learn fox-trotting or playing the
piano; and the poorer ones take it up because it is a cheap way to
learn English or any other of the matters of instruction that the
missionaries hold out as bait. What else have we gotten morally or
culturally from you that was better than our own? We are losing
our art, manners, morals, and getting instead your freak futurism,
your jazz and your cocktail-drinking, leg-displaying flapper. Now,
I'm willing to admit that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> all that amuses me. I enjoy the dancing,
the freedom with these girls. I have a better time with them than I
possibly shall have with the girl of the type whom I shall marry;
but, heavens, I don't marry a wife for entertainment, because she's
a good fellow. I marry a girl whom I can respect as a mother to my
children. Mind you, I don't want to seem to criticize your system.
It may suit you entirely, be just the thing for you; but it is
entirely inapplicable to us. Your country is run on the theory of the
development and the rights of the individual. In Japan the basis of our
entire social system and body politic is the family. In America, where
each individual must look after the expression of his own personality,
it is plain that marriage must be by personal selection, though I admit
it astounded me,&mdash;what I saw in America. A young man and a girl meet,
dance. 'Here, your step just fits in with mine. Let's get married.'
You know, it's almost as bad as that; and then, when you have let
themselves tie themselves up thus unthinkingly, you make it almost
impossible for them to remedy it if it's a mistake. Divorce must be due
to some disgraceful reason,&mdash;adultery, desertion, failure to provide;
one must either continue to drag out life in a marriage which is a
curse to the parties thereto and which does no good to the community,
or prove oneself some kind of a beast. In Japan we make marriage a
serious matter, try to give it the best possible chance for permanency
for the sake of the community and of the State; but incidentally the
parties themselves benefit. When you read the papers of America and
those of Japan&mdash;and ours are, if anything, more sensational than
yours&mdash;you'll find that on the whole we have far fewer marriage messes
than you have.</p>

<p>"That's why I shall marry a girl who will place her duty to her
family above everything else, who will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> content with her home,
flower arrangement, ceremonial tea, looking after her children and
her husband. There won't be much excitement in it, or fun, but then,
if I want that, I can find it elsewhere. I don't marry for fun or for
excitement. I marry to form a family.</p>

<p>"So there is one thing where you may call me reactionary, if you like,
and that's in respect to women. When I saw in America your eternally
jazzing, slangy, impertinent flapper, the girl who bobs her hair and
'rolls them below the knee,' I was told is the phrase, and when I
saw the inroads which this phenomenon, this freakish caricature of
womanhood, was beginning to make in Japan, with some of our girls who
want to be modern, by talking woman's rights, and personal expression,
and free love and all that, then I said to myself, yes, Japan owes much
to Western civilization, and we may yet gain much from it; but when it
comes to the women, the family relations, let us keep out the Western
system as we would a plague."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I understand," Kent spoke drily. "I see your point; still it
seems to me a bit rough on the women, especially those like the Suzuki
girls. You've surprised me, Kikuchi-san. I thought you were among the
foremost of the moderns."</p>

<p>"And why am I not?" He snapped out the retort. "Simply because I
don't want to see Japan adopt a system which has resulted in a riot
of divorce scandals, married women running loose, the family system a
mockery? And yet, Kent-san you know that we young men in Japan cannot
justly be accused of being reactionary, and you know that we are likely
to have on our hands problems so pressing that we won't have time to
dabble with drawing-room sex questions. Can you find it illustrated
any better than it is in the case of us younger men in the Foreign
Office? We know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> jolly well that the General Staff is still running
the country; we see our diplomats humiliated continually when, after
they have bound Japan to some international agreement, the militarists
cynically walk right through it and leave us to wipe up the mess as
best we can, leaving us a laughing stock and placing Japan in the
position of a nation whose word is worth nothing.</p>

<p>"Do you know that all we are waiting for is a chance to get rid of the
older men, these pussyfoot, over-careful old men who now run affairs,
and to fight it out with the militarists. We shall have the people
with us. We must have a government for the people and not for the army
and navy. It's bound to come. The government is rotten as it is, with
the General Staff doing as it pleases without being responsible to the
Cabinet; with the officials nothing but politicians, many of them in
the pay of this or that of the big interests. That's why they call them
geisha politicians, because, like geisha, they are being kept by rich
men. What can you expect where the Premier gets six thousand dollars
and the Cabinet Ministers four thousand dollars a year and their
underlings in proportion? That's what we have got to do away with, that
and favoritism because of money or title. You know, I'm not going to
accept the title when my father dies. Peerages should last only one
generation; should go only to the men who earn them. And I'm not the
only one of my class who feels like this. There are many of us. Evil
days have come on Japan; the country is being run for the benefit of
the few, a rotten, corrupt bureaucracy in the service of plutocracy;
or by the militarists, who may be patriotic enough, according to their
lights, but who have become anachronistic&mdash;so they must go, too.
Remember, Kent-san, no matter how badly things may look on the surface
that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> see, the great bulk of the Japanese people remains as it
was, patriotic, frugal, hard-working, eager to learn. They will give
Japan its great future, these masses, and that task is what interests
me, not chattering over sex sentimentalities with flappers. Girls like
Kimiko-san, dancing, jazz and the rest, are all very well as a pastime
in one's leisure, just as are geisha, but when it comes to the serious
affairs of life, pah!" he waved his hand, snapping the fingers. "You
get me, Kent-san?"</p>

<p>Kimiko's sister brought the news, that afternoon, that the parents
were ready to surrender. They had already called off the go-between.
Kimiko-san would never again be exposed to marriage without being
consulted first. They all had tea. It should have been a gay occasion;
Karsten tried desperately to bring about an atmosphere of high spirits;
but the feeling of uneasiness, high-strung quiver of excitement,
would not away. The women were ever together, the girls and Jun-san,
whispering, fluttery. For some reason it was a failure. It was almost
with a sense of relief that they saw the girls to the gate.</p>

<p>"Poor little things." Kent was looking down at them as they tripped
down the stone stairway, hand in hand, a pretty, entrancing picture,
one in the fashion of the West, chic turban, high-heeled shoes, narrow
waist; the other dainty, richly colored, brilliant, with her gorgeous
obi, widely drooping kimono sleeves. At the foot of the stairs they
stopped, waved; then they climbed into the waiting automobile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sorry for them," said Karsten. "They are so eager to adopt
our civilization, our modernism; they try so hard; and the better they
succeed the worse it will probably be for them. They're ahead of their
day, victims of the transition period, poor little butterflies broken
on the wheel."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>Sylvia was in Tokyo.</p>

<p>He tried to beat down the wave-crest of emotion, happiness, that surged
over him, gripped him and shook him. He wanted none of it, wished
desperately to fight against it. It was all right for him to be pleased
to see her again, to be with her, but this titillating on the verge
of transports of joy&mdash;he would simply have to keep a tight hold on
himself. The situation held too many potentialities of complications,
uncertainties, distress. Even the way in which the news of her coming
had reached him had illustrated, oddly, the curious blend of the bitter
and the sweet which the situation held. It had been the Tinker hag
again. She had caught him at tea, had seized upon him and led him to
a secluded corner that she might enjoy in every detail, undisturbed,
his reaction to the dénouement. Probably she had overcome a desire
to fare forth and shout out the news in the market place, had kept
it for him, so that she might be the first to communicate it. It was
her hobby, probably the only interest which kept her alive, this
interest in living, this contriving complicated situations among her
acquaintances in order that she might satisfy a morbidly curious and
perverted taste for the dramatic by gloating over their display of the
more unusual emotions, their unguarded laying bare before her avid
eye the reactions usually painstakingly held in check. He had been
irritatedly aware of the greedy glare of this old woman; it was almost
indecent; as she watched him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> rapaciously solicitous lest she fail to
catch the slightest indication of face or voice which might betray his
feelings. He did not think she could have gotten much out of it. He
thought he had played up well. Still, one could never know. Anyway, it
was disquieting, disgusting, that the return of Sylvia, after all this
time, should immediately revive the watchfulness of the idle women,
should so wantonly render complicated, almost impossible, intimate
relation with this girl.</p>

<p>And, now, what about Sylvia? Did she know that he had become free? How
long had she known it? Had she just heard of it and returned forthwith?
No; he dismissed that thought. But might she not have heard some
time ago and simply allowed a decent interval to elapse in order to
avoid giving the gossips grist for their mills? But he caught himself
up sharply. What an ass he was to imagine, vaingloriously, that he
had entered into her considerations at all. Presumably she had been
governed by entirely different motives, something not even remotely
connected with him. What grounds had he to imagine that his presence
was of the slightest moment to her. Of course, it did seem as if she
must have left Tokyo on account of the gossip connecting him with her;
but, after all, that proved nothing, could certainly not by even the
most fanciful contortion of imagination be construed into an indication
of feeling related to affection. No, he was an ass.</p>

<p>The only thing he could do would be to sit tight and suffer matters to
occur as they might. He was curious to meet her&mdash;he sternly insisted to
himself that that was all&mdash;and yet he rather dreaded it, wondered what
he should say, how he should act. He would leave it to her to take the
lead. Women did these things better than men, had finer perceptions,
possessed an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>instinctive sureness with which they could handle deftly
such delicate situations.</p>

<p>So when he met her, he was not much surprised that the incident seemed
almost commonplace. Luckily, there were others at the time whom she
met also for the first time since her return. She treated him exactly
like these, included him with those others with the usual drab,
conventional commonplaces. It almost irritated him that the meeting
had been so trivial. Was she then not interested? It piqued him. Well,
why shouldn't he find out. He was free now, and if he did care for
her&mdash;there was no denying that she interested him immensely, that
she still had that old charm for him, yes, hang it, that he did care
for, that he might easily come to love her. And why not? Came back to
his mind the charm of the days when he and she had been close, when
he had been afraid to dally with the thought of her in the place of
Isabel. He need not fear that now. He had the right to. And if it had
been pleasant then, why not now, why not allow himself the felicity
of dreaming that dream. He warmed to the thought, a glow of sheer
pleasure and happiness suffused him. Of course. He would be careful to
be tactful. She was tremendously sensitive and he must take care not
to spoil everything by being too precipitate, but he would watch his
chance.</p>

<p>It took time, still, as he felt his way slowly, with anxious care,
holding himself in check, carefully consolidating such little gains as
he made before venturing an infinitely small step forward, he felt that
they were gradually approaching something like the old relation. He
had even come to the point where they had made a few small excursions
together. But they were few and separated by intervals that seemed
infinitely long, and he fretted under the necessity of keeping himself
in hand. Now that he was allowing himself to consider,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> at least as a
remote potentiality, the idea of love, the situation became ever so
much more complicated, was more difficult to manage. He must not allow
himself to think of this too much. In the back of his mind remained
the uneasy thought that he had loved Isabel, had ardently desired to
marry her&mdash;and then his marriage had been a failure, anyway. If one
failed once, one might do so twice. After all, love was often mainly
something contrived by oneself. One took love of an image conjured
up by one's imagination for love of the woman; it might be a sort of
auto-intoxication. He must be sure of himself. He must force himself to
be rational, to refrain from letting fancy take charge of what should
be the function of the brain. Anyway, there was plenty of work to do.
He would use work as a counterirritant.</p>

<p>Japan had suddenly launched into one of its periods of frantic
excitement. First came news from Manchuria, where Chang Tso-lin
was moving a great expedition to drive the Soviet troops out of
Mongolia. Conservative papers registered perfunctory surprise at the
completeness of his equipment, motor transport, field artillery, even
airplanes; but most of the papers, the people generally, sneered
contemptuously, shrugged shoulders. It was an old story. Of course,
the Manchurian war-lord could have obtained them from only one source,
the militarists. The War Office issued its usual denial, which no
one believed. Presently came news of attacks by Chinese bandits on
settlements in the South Manchuria Railway territory, massacres
of Japanese colonists, clashes with Japanese police, burning of a
consulate or two. From high official sources, unnamed, but generously
quoted in the press, were given out alarming statements. It was the
Bolshevik menace, irresponsible hordes of Manchuria, malcontent
Koreans, being goaded on by mysterious machinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> from Moscow. It
would be necessary to move troops into Manchuria to protect the railway
region, especially now that Chang Tso-lin was engaged in Mongolia and
could not protect neighboring territory. The divisions in Korea were
moved inland. It would be necessary to send fresh troops to Korea. Of
course, it would be impossible to consider the proposition to reduce
the army at the session of the Diet which was just about to meet.</p>

<p>The people murmured; again the feeling became prevalent that a great
militaristic scheme was being carried out, cleverly hidden by the
uniformed old men up there in the copper-roofed building towering
on the hill beyond the Foreign Office. Opinions were divided. Some
insisted that Japanese lives must be avenged, colonists protected,
the dignity of the Empire upheld; others cried out bitterly that the
entire turmoil was but part of a great plot ingeniously hatched out by
the General Staff. Some papers claimed to have proof that this was but
another attempt to carry out the favorite old military plan, to have
a buffer state created by Chang Tso-lin and remnants of White Russian
factions; that the bandits were backed by Chang, that the very rifles
which had dealt out death to Japanese had been furnished in mysterious
roundabout ways by the War Office. It was hinted that the massacres
were, in fact, quite welcome to the General Staff, that they were a
part of the whole scheme.</p>

<p>It was a busy period for Kent. News was breaking constantly, here
and there, in unexpected quarters. It was intensely interesting at
first, sending story upon story over the wire, each one conveying
the tingling feeling of anticipation that each day was bringing
nearer some great event, some cataclysm, indefinite but gradually
assuming certainty, something overwhelming, big news. But events were
happening too quickly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>&mdash;the staccato hammering of situation after
situation, the Manchurian affair, army bill, rice scandal, Diet fights,
police charges, rumors and revelations, farmer revolts and riots in
the cities, all became a conglomerate chaos of excitement, a whirl
of incidents flickering by with dizzily shifting changes, making
concentration on any one of them almost impossible. Like the nation in
general, Kent found himself unable to maintain the high key of excited
absorption; one became overwhelmed as if by a succession of great
waves, one following so closely after the other that the mind, battered
and bewildered, failing to register complete, clear impression of each
one, became in reaction dulled, exhausted, almost apathetic. After
all, this ubiquitous clamor, this constantly flickering and flashing
of new heterogeneous pictures, produced finally but an impression
of a stupendous blur; one became exhausted by the repetition of
explosions of excitement, causing one to hold one's breath, nervously,
in expectancy of some prodigious dénouement, a political deluge, that
constantly impended but which always seemed to fall just short, to
evaporate harmlessly as each happening became overshadowed by the
occurrence of some new and astounding development.</p>

<p>It became necessary to remain almost constantly near the center of
affairs, to be in readiness to snap up the news events which flashed
forth with explosive suddenness, like lightning from a hovering
thunder cloud. It became his custom to spend much of his time at the
Imperial Hotel. It was close to the Diet building, the Foreign Office,
the central police station, and when things were quiet, when there
was nothing to do but wait, he enjoyed the atmosphere, the feeling
of remoteness from the humdrum surroundings of everyday modernity,
which was conveyed to him by this enormous structure of fantastic
masonry where genius had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> contrived to work out in permanencies of
stone and bronze the delicate and ephemeral fancies of an opulent
dream image. Resting in a remote corner among the myriad corniced
recesses which gave on the spacious vestibule, his eye found constant
delight in the intricacy of detail, embroidery-like stone pillar,
fretwork and balustrades, gilded mortar binding together complicated
interlacing designs; the flood of colors of rugs and cushions&mdash;browns,
ocher, terracotta and maroon, and blues, ultra-marine, lapis lazuli,
indigo&mdash;in a riot of shadings and combinations, and all of it, colors
and contours, blended into a great harmonious whole, impressive,
inspiring, so it seemed almost a sacrilege that this mirage-like
brilliance should be profaned by the comings and goings of mere hotel
guests and townsfolk bent on prosaic concerns of business.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, at tea time, it was especially pleasant, when the
Russian orchestra played. Flicker of color of butterfly-winged kimonos
would animate the scene with a glimmer of exotic rich life. They really
fitted into the picture, these young girls of the Japanese aristocracy,
with their undulating, polychromatic textures, and when the music lent
itself to the forming of a picture, some symphony or bit of opera, one
might dream oneself surrounded by an Arabian Nights setting, or a scene
from "Aïda."</p>

<p>Here one might meet every one who counted at all in the ultra-modern
life of Tokyo, foreigners and Japanese, business men, newspapermen,
young fellows from the embassies, in the bar; and, upstairs, in the
lobby or in Peacock Alley, the women at tea. Kent often saw the Suzuki
girls there. Kimiko seemed happy enough, showed no trace of the
incident which had brought her to him. But he came principally for the
chance that it afforded him to see Sylvia. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been a strenuous afternoon, but a disappointing one. A stormy
scene had been expected in the Diet. He had sat in the gallery for
hours, listening to dreary debate, hoping that momentarily something
would happen; had made the rounds of the Foreign Office, newspaper
offices, even the lair of old Viscount Kikuchi&mdash;but nothing out of the
ordinary had occurred. Now the Diet had adjourned until the following
morning; the crowds had dispersed. He was glad to see Sylvia alone at
one of the tables overlooking the inner court.</p>

<p>"You're just the one I want to see. It's been a maddening day; lots of
work and no results. May I sit with you?"</p>

<p>"Of course, but I'm afraid I cannot be with you long, although, as a
matter of fact, I'm trying to make a sort of a meal here. I'm off on an
expedition of my own, and I shall have no dinner until late, midnight
maybe."</p>

<p>An expedition. He urged her not to be mysterious. She soon gave in.
After all, it was entirely professional. She intended to go to the
great Nichiren temple at Ikegami, a few miles from Tokyo. It would
be full moon and she had always had an idea that there might be a
picture there for her, some fantastic harmonious blending of contour of
gnarled pines, curved temple roofs, which might be enhanced, softened,
etherealized by moonbeam glamor.</p>

<p>"I'm not at all sure that there will be a picture there, at least not
for me. I may not be able to get enough color out of it; but I want
the experience, anyway, the eeriness of the hundreds of old graves in
the cryptomeria shadows. I have been wanting to go for a long time; so
to-night I'm going."</p>

<p>The idea appealed to him instantly. "I wish you'd let me come with
you." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid it might be rather unconventional, would it not?" she
hesitated.</p>

<p>"It would be still more unconventional if you went alone. You should
have an escort. I shan't disturb you. I promise you that I shall be as
dumb and unobtrusive as your walking-stick; but, really, I do wish you
would let me come along."</p>

<p>She looked at him reflectively. He wondered what thoughts were forming
behind these fine, black eyes; the desire to go with her, which had
been only an inspirational whim, took deeper hold. She must let him
come. He leaned forward earnestly. She smiled. "Very well, then. I
suppose you might as well come; but remember, I shall be at work; I
shall want to think, to absorb. You must be as you promised, just
inanimate, a block of wood."</p>

<p>He promised hastily, curiously noting in himself a feeling of trembling
pleasure. They finished their tea and took the electric train to Omori.</p>

<p>Twilight was falling when they reached the village. They walked through
narrow winding lanes, past tall bamboo fences enclosing spacious
gardens, came to the open country, rice fields, scattered groups of
houses clustered on tree-clad hills. In the gathering shadows crickets
were tuning up for their serenades; the moon, rising from behind the
pine groves on the Ikegami ridge, bathed the landscape with soft
luminosity.</p>

<p>As they climbed the long broad stone stairway leading up to the temple
heights, they heard the monotonous euphony of a chant. At a minor
shrine close to the entrance a priest was engaged in some ceremonial.
As they stood by the stone foxes guarding the entrance to the small
court fronting it, they could see his vestmented figure, kneeling,
facing the dimly illuminated gorgeousness of gilt, and brocade, and
lacquer, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> glimpse of resplendent Oriental opulence devoted to
mysterious, age-old rites.</p>

<p>They passed on. The rest of the temple grounds lay in darkness,
illuminated sparingly by a few faint electric lights, irritatingly
modern amidst all the ancient buildings, lofty cryptomerias, crumbling
tombs. They passed along the broad stone-paved path, smoothed by wear
of feet of generations of worshipers, under the massive, towering
crimson gateway leading into the inner court. Here was a plateau
on the hilltop, whence ran on all sides corrugations of ridges and
valleys, set with hundreds of graves, carved stone monuments, lichened
sepulchers, broodingly silent in the shadows of fantastically gnarled
pine limbs.</p>

<p>The main temple buildings were closed. The wide court was bathed
in moonlight, brilliant, white, setting out in strong relief every
detail of contour of curved roof, carved pillars, bronze figures
anachronistically finding in their midst a battered rapid-fire gun,
trophy from the Russian War. But it was all too brightly visible, too
plainly seen; the eeriness, the nebulous awe of obscure mystery, lay
beyond, all about them, among the graves in the shadows of the pines.</p>

<p>From the right of the courtyard, near the gateway, a pathway ran,
straight as a sword, penetrating into the heart of the pine grove, a
chasm of opalescent light, a shimmery gorge of white brilliance in
abrupt contrast to the almost solid walls of blackness, leading like a
fantastically contrived magic road to a pagoda, which closed it, with
intricately carved roof set upon roof, rising with slender elegance
towards the dark sapphire heavens. It formed a picture, but strange,
eccentrically unusual, without color&mdash;pale, shimmery, pearly&mdash;set
against ebony blackness. It seemed to him that it would be impossible
to express it through the ordinary media of the brush; as if it might
be worked out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> only by some odd special process, mother-of-pearl and
teak; but even then it would lose the peculiar scintillating brilliance
which seemed to make even the blackness luminous.</p>

<p>He looked at the girl, wondering what she was getting out of it. She
was entirely absorbed, eyes intent, frowning in thought, perplexity.
She shook her head. "No. Come."</p>

<p>They crossed the courtyard, found a path leading behind one of the main
buildings and an old, crumbling edifice, rotting, giving forth moldy
odor of decay. It led down into a lower stratum of ridges and gullies,
slippery flags laid between mounds and hillsides, twisting and turning,
with stone stairways, leading upwards, downwards, among thousands of
ancient burial plots. Over it all lay the murky shadows of cryptomeria,
slashed here and there by bright streaks of pale moonlight. The
silence seemed uncannily brooding, ominously oppressive, riven only by
spasmodic droning booms from a great brass bell, somewhere deep in the
shadows behind them, reverberating shiveringly through the shadows.</p>

<p>It was as if they were enveloped in an atmosphere of the supernatural,
as if they had willfully intruded into a realm of ghosts and specters,
a scene set for mysterious <i>danse macabre</i>-like rites, rash beings
possessed of the ephemeral spark of life of the moment interfering with
their puny inconsequential presence in this, the realm of those who had
held sway here for centuries.</p>

<p>She had taken his arm; now she was clinging to him closely. He could
feel her shivering nervously. The feeling was infectious, crept over
him irritatingly. He brought himself together. "Come, you are getting
nervous. Let us rest for a moment before going on."</p>

<p>He led her up a stairway leading to the top of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> small eminence, an
enclosure surrounded by a low stone balustrade, evidently the private
burial place of some family of the nobility of remote medieval days. In
the open space surrounded on all sides by blackness the illumination
seemed almost dazzling, brilliantly white, with a spotlight effect,
enhancing the sense of unearthliness, remoteness from the world of
material things.</p>

<p>They found a fallen stone pillar and seated themselves. She remained
silent, staring out into this spectral ghost world, the fantastic
eccentricities of shapes and contours, where everything was black and
white only, like a gigantic etching. He, watching her, became absorbed
in turn. He was pleased that she fitted into the scene, even into the
Oriental setting, a filmy silk shawl lending a kimono-like effect, her
great pile of raven hair suggestive of the high Japanese coiffure.
Whimsically, out of nowhere, came the idea to him: thank providence,
she was not a blonde! It would have spoiled the effect which she was
now producing&mdash;fine, clear profile, pale features, black hair blending
into the picture formed by mass-grown monuments, great carved lanterns,
outlined sharply in the suffusion of moonlight.</p>

<p>The whole thing seemed unreal, as if they had found themselves suddenly
in a world centuries removed from that in which they usually moved, as
if they had become participants in an elfin play, were on the brink of
the enacting of something supernatural, some midsummer night's dream
fancy, or a dance of specters; as if they might expect momentarily to
hear some unseen goblin orchestra strike into an overture of tinkling
bluebells, insect violins, bumblebee bassoons, murmur of night wind,
leading them, this girl and himself, into some scene of dreamlike
phantasy in which they had fortuitously become the main characters. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>What a setting for romance! These surroundings, this girl, this wonder
of pure, harmonious perfection! Somehow, he felt that it would be
impossible to create again this same effect, that it could not be
consciously contrived merely by coming to this place any moonlight
night with the determination, purposely, of summoning the spell.
There came to him a feeling that this could be attained only once in
a lifetime, that he was impassively, fatuously failing to seize the
immeasurably rare opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Opportunity for what? He shook himself together. He was becoming
moonstruck. After all, this girl&mdash;&mdash; She did not notice his gaze. It
was fascinating to watch her, the infinitely fine play of light in
her eyes, her impatient frown in concentration of thoughts which were
almost palpable, visible. And yet, what did she think? It occurred that
in the same manner he had speculated as to the thoughts which might
lurk behind the white brows of Kimiko-san, Sadako-san and the rest. How
different they must be; fine, dreamlike, exotic, quaint as might be
the ideas of those girls, would not the glamor thereof, the ephemeral
delicacy, fade as one became familiar with them, become commonplace,
irritatingly trite after wear of years of association? Here, on the
other hand, was a brain capable of absorbing the most subtle and
evasive expressions of life, existence in its varied manifestations, of
shaping them into concrete, lasting form, creative, a mind like one's
own, or even more capable, which would grow, develop like an unfolding
blossom, presenting ever new beauties and richness in years of life
together.</p>

<p>Without conscious thought, acting entirely on impulse, he leaned
towards her. She looked at him, awakened suddenly from her reverie. "I
must be poor company," she smiled. "But then, you know, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> told you
beforehand. It is all so bewildering, puzzling to me. I can see the
pictures here, the dazzlingly wonderful potentialities which lie right
here before me, about me; and yet I can't get hold of it. It eludes me
entirely. It is the lack of color, I think, the predominance of light
and shadow effects, black and white. It is not for me, I'm afraid.
This is a subject for some great etcher, for some kind of a Klinger or
Boeklin composition; and yet one would have to get in these elusive
opalescent tints, these evasive iridescences. It is very disappointing,
to feel it all so far beyond one's capabilities; and yet I have enjoyed
it so much. I have let it get away with me. But now it must be late.
Come," she took his hand simply, confidently. "We must be going home.
You must forgive me if I have let the moonlight run away with my
thoughts. But didn't you feel something like that too? Did you not feel
coming to you dreams, visions that, even though they must fade away and
lose their evanescence, will still continue to live in some form, to
take shape in one's life."</p>

<p>He did not answer. The dream was already beginning to concentrate, to
solidify into definite form of thought, purpose. He wondered whether it
were possible that she might divine, by some subtle woman's intuition,
the inspiration which was now growing into tangible form of a wish,
deliberate pursuance of desire, that now finally he was sure that she
was the woman whom he had been awaiting, that he had come to the end of
his seeking.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>"Thank God, that's over," said Butterfield. "If there's anything much
more deadly than the banquets of the Nippon-Columbia Society, I don't
want to see it."</p>

<p>They had come down from the banquet hall in the Imperial Hotel, a group
of correspondents, Kittrick, Kent, Butterfield and Templeton, with
Roberts, just arrived from New York to gather material for a series of
magazine articles; Sands, an engineer who had something to do with the
new subway, and one or two others. At one end of Peacock Alley they
found a table where they might observe the crowd, the men coming down
here to meet the women who had dined below in the main dining room,
Japanese and foreigners mingling, concentrating in little groups about
the guests of honor, an eminent engineer from America, a Cabinet member
from Washington, and a couple of Congressmen of whom no one in Tokyo
had heard until they arrived in Japan, unofficially, of course, it was
given out, but as "Ambassadors of Friendship," as the newspapers called
them.</p>

<p>Butterfield was still grouching. "Here I've been to dozens of these
affairs, and I wonder if I'll ever come away from one without a bad
taste in my mouth. It makes me sick, all this fulsomeness. Take
to-night, Barry talking as if the Japanese were the only engineers
in the world, as if they had invented the steam engine, electricity,
telephones, radio and all that. Here Japan is suffering so badly from
swelled head that the best service one may do her is to tell her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
truth, for her own good, and still whenever we have distinguished
visitors here, they always insist on making asses of themselves. Barry
is a pleasant enough, kindly old ass, but, heavens, the only way I
could stand his speech to-night was by watching Matthews. He has in
one way or another been behind half the things that Barry was lauding
our Japanese friends for. Did you see his face? It was the only fun I
got out of it all, seeing Matthews' face getting redder and redder. I
thought he'd have a fit. But all the rest of it honestly gets my goat;
the main table, with old Count Ibara sitting through the speeches
waiting for the time when he'll have a chance to spring his eternal
story about his college days with President Wilson. I can stand on
my head and write a complete report of these meetings as they were
ten years ago, as they will be ten years from now; old Baron Nishida
leads off with "Perry's Black Ships" and everlasting love for America.
Eminent American stands up and talks of Bushido&mdash;I have lived here ten
years, and I've yet to hear Bushido mentioned by a Japanese; it's as
dead as the rules of knighthood with us&mdash;more Eminent Americans tell
the Japanese how wonderful they are. Why the devil is it that when an
American comes here, he must almost invariably make a fool of himself?
Of course, the trouble is often that they are generally mediocrities
who become all puffed up at the attentions they get here; and then we
do send out such asses. Do you remember the Congressional Party some
years ago? The men acted like clodhoppers, and their women were worse.
That's where the Japanese are wiser than we are. When they let any one
represent them, officially or semi-officially, abroad, they hand-pick
them, send only the best they have, and our people at home get a
wonderful idea of the advanced stage of Japan. That's how half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
good spirit towards Japan was built up at the Washington Conference;
they sent their best men in the entourage of the delegation, who
chummed with our newspapermen and writers; the best kind of advertising.</p>

<p>"But we let loose third-rate Congressmen, ebullient business men, who
let Japanese hospitality get to their heads and proceed to slobber all
over the landscape. I wouldn't mind if it were not for the fact that
just as we in America judge the Japanese people from the Japanese who
make a splash there, thus the Japanese judge us Americans from the kind
of specimens who come over here and spill their foolishness as these
fellows did to-night. We Americans ought to have a censorship here to
prevent visiting notables from making speeches which have not been
carefully edited."</p>

<p>"But what do you come here for then, if you dislike it so?" It was
Roberts, the magazine man. "Why do you belong to the Society at all if
you think it does no good?"</p>

<p>"But I don't say that. I admit it does good. Anything does that brings
Americans and Japanese together in a friendly way. But what I object
to is the effervescence of our visitors. I think it is proper that we
should be courteous, cordial, friendly towards the Japanese, but what's
the use of telling them that we think they love us, when we know darned
well they don't. That old chap at the left of Barry tried some time
ago in the Privy Council to have the <i>Japan American</i> suppressed for
no reason except that it had translated some embarrassing editorials
from a Japanese paper. The business premises of Americans are ransacked
by the police and accusations are constantly being made that 'a
certain nation' is cramming this country with spies; some of our most
prominent <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>engineering firms are having their business seriously
interfered with because of constant 'spy' charges. They have no use
for us, and they have no use for England. They think we euchred them
at the Washington Conference. They feel that when we called off on
militarism, we did away with the one chance which Japan had to be a
great nation. They have no use for us big nations who, they feel, are
constantly interfering with the development of the policies they would
like to pursue in Asia. Mind you, I believe in being friendly&mdash;it's
indefensible to stir up needless trouble between America and Japan&mdash;but
I don't believe in slopping over, and I think it is right to let them
know that we know jolly well how they feel about us. The funny thing
is, Roberts, and every man who has lived here any time will tell you
the same, that just as sentiment in America towards Japan has become
more and more friendly since the Washington Conference, in the same
ratio Japanese sentiment is becoming unfriendly towards America. It may
be largely the doings of the militarists. Possibly they're the ones who
are egging the police on with these eternal spy scares. It may be part
of their plans to counteract the general agitation for army reduction;
to justify an army, there must be a potential enemy, and America is
the most obvious one. So put it down to the militarists, if you like.
They're the official goat, anyway."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the popular game to-day, cussing the militarists," cut
in Kent. "Still, you know, I can see their point of view even if, God
knows, I condemn their methods. Look here, there's no use denying that
just one thing made Japan great, her army and navy. Take them away,
and the other Powers would put her in the class of, say, Spain. Now we
have decreed that hereafter we will measure nations by industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> and
commercial greatness, and the Japanese see that they're being left way
behind. The militarists see that Japan can remain great only in the
same way as she became great, by the sword. Now, it's probably sure
enough that they have given up the old idea of an offensive outside of
Asia; but what I think they are working up to is establishing a line of
defense to the eastward, and once that's complete, they will be ready
to do as they please in Asia; probably they feel that we won't easily
be led into war against them, anyway.</p>

<p>"And it seems plain that they must go into the continent of Asia.
That's where they must get raw materials for their industries which
they haven't at home. That's the only place to which we'll let them
emigrate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell, don't spring that worn-out theory of Japan's overflowing,"
interrupted Templeton. "As Japan industrializes, she'll take care of
her population; and there's still room in Japan for lots of additional
people. Premier Hara himself told me once that there was room for
millions in Hokkaido alone."</p>

<p>"Sure," Kent flashed back. "Just as there's lots of room in America for
the Americans. We don't have to emigrate, and still we would resent
it, wouldn't we, if we were told that we couldn't go where we pleased.
Here Japan sees her friends, America and Great Britain, possessing
enormous tracts that lie idle for want of settlers&mdash;take Australia, for
instance, where they are yelling for immigrants, and still they won't
let the Japanese in&mdash;and while the Japanese would like to go there, and
would develop these lands highly, as we all know, we tell them no, stay
home in icy Hokkaido. You talk about worn-out theories, Templeton; what
about that old stuff about Japanese driving out the whites wherever
they enter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> How is a nation of less than sixty millions going to
swarm all over America and Australia and the rest of the earth. They
may breed like rabbits, but they would have to breed like herrings to
do that. And, anyway, even if we must keep them from immigrating into
America in masses&mdash;as we ought to keep out the hordes of low class
Latins and Slavs, people a sight lower than the Japanese, whom we have
let overrun our country&mdash;we might be less offensive about it. We all
know that what makes Japan sore is not the fact that she can't send
her surplus over to America; the Japanese Government wants them to go
west, not east, in fact; but it's the insult to her race pride, the
circumstance that a Doctor Takamine, a Doctor Kitisato, people who rank
among the best brains in the world, can't become American citizens,
should they wish to do so; but under our laws we can give citizenship
to Kaffirs and Hottentots, anything that's black and comes out of
Africa.</p>

<p>"You're looking into conditions in the Far East, Roberts. Take a look
at that angle of the question. We, the Anglo-Saxons, insist on holding
the Oriental down. We say that's not because we think he's lower than
we are, but what are mere words? We're judged by our actions. Now,
you notice how the Japanese papers every now and then break out with
Pan-Asia propaganda, calling for a combination of the peoples of China,
of India, of all Asia, to stand together against the White, under
Japan's 'hegemony,' as they put it. If you'd been here at the time
Kemal Pasha was telling England to go to Hades, you would have noticed
how the Japanese press applauded him; here, they boasted joyfully, was
finally an Asiatic defying the Anglo-Saxon, the Christian, and getting
away with it. We're bringing it upon ourselves. Japan has lost lots of
chances in the past to become the leader of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> Asia, but she may become
so yet; and that's what I think may be the militarist policy; either
they aspire to hold Japan in readiness to lead the rest of Asia, or
they may simply be preparing for the next time Europe and America are
too busy elsewhere to watch Asia, and then take what they want in
Manchuria and Mongolia. When you look upon all these things in the
light that the Japanese militarist looks upon them, you can, at least,
understand what he's driving at. I'm not a jingo. War between Japan
and America would be the most silly, the most damnable thing you can
think of; but I don't think we are using the best methods to avoid
it. Instead of going so strong on the brotherhood stuff, hands across
the seas and empty words, we should try to understand Japan a little
better. As it is, I'm sure that the nation at large, the Government as
represented by the Foreign Office, for instance, wants only friendship;
but you must remember that the General Staff is still running things to
a large extent, and is there any one of you who doesn't think they do
not expect war with us sometime, sooner or later?"</p>

<p>"Suppose they do," Sands, the engineer, leaned forward. "What hope can
they have of success? The next war will be fought in the air, they say,
and there Japan is helpless. We run regular air-mail services from
the Atlantic to the Pacific. The Japanese have not as yet been able
to stage a mail flight between Tokyo and Osaka, a few hundred miles,
without having participants dropping to earth. The Japanese have no
machine sense; they can run an engine when it's running smoothly, but
they're at sea in an emergency. That's why they're always tumbling
down with their airplanes. And modern war depends on industrial
organization, ability to work up and maintain tremendous outputs of
material. Japan simply hasn't the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> ability to do that. She'd be beaten
on that point alone."</p>

<p>"You may be right, Sands," Kittrick took up the argument. "But it is
not a question of war just now or for some years to come, thank God.
The next point of difference, I take it, will be the racial equality
question that has been smoldering ever since the Paris Conference. And
that's just where the world has been treating Japan wrong, granting
national equality, but not racial. It should be just the opposite.
I'm willing to grant any moment that racially the Japanese is as good
as we are and a sight better than lots of the white scum we admit to
citizenship, but nationally, no, sir; as long as Japan is run as she
is at present, with militarists capable of and quite willing to break
the nation's international pledges, no matter how sincere the diplomats
may or may not be in making them, just so long do I object to national
equality. The individual Japanese may be quite as good intrinsically as
we are, but the present system is not bringing out his capabilities,
and to contend that Japan is as great a nation as America or England is
plain rot."</p>

<p>"So you would want to admit Japanese to American citizenship?" asked
Roberts.</p>

<p>"Only after they had assimilated American training and ideals; but that
is just the point; as they are here in Japan I don't think they're
fit for citizenship of any country, any more than are the low-class
Europeans we import; but I contend that they are just as capable of
assimilation as are any other nationals. There's a bird here in Tokyo
who used to be in charge of the school system in Hawaii where forty per
cent. of the school children are Japanese, and he tells me that these
kiddies, under American training, are becoming as capable, as honest
and as loyal Americans as are any children under the flag, white, black
or brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> The American-trained Japanese is as efficient as we are;
the Japanese-trained Japanese is ineffective; it takes four or five
of them to do the work that a white man can do. It all shows that the
fault lies with the government here, the whole system. There's nothing
the matter with the Japanese; he's the same, mentally and morally as
the rest of us, with a few virtues such as cleanliness and industry
thrown in, but you have to take him away from the atmosphere here, of
incapacity, deceit, graft, the spirit that is exemplified by their
proverb: '<i>Uso wa Nihon no takara</i>.'"</p>

<p>"What's that, what's that?" Roberts had been taking it all in anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's simply a proverb to the effect that lies, deceit, craft,
whatever you may choose to call it, is the treasure of Japan. It's a
fine sentiment for a proverb, isn't it? Still it's fairly typical of
the situation. In fact, I think that that point, the fact that Japan
regards falsehood, deceit, in a light far more lenient than we do,
accounts more than anything else for the feeling of racial difference
between us. The average Japanese does not greatly mind being caught
in a lie; it conveys no distinct sense of shame to him; it's simply
a difference in ethical viewpoint, just as the Japanese look with
abhorrence on some of our ethical shortcomings, our comparatively scant
respect for old age, and all that&mdash;but it's the variant in Japanese
character which we find it the hardest to understand."</p>

<p>"You claim then that all Japanese are liars, to put it tersely?"
insisted Roberts.</p>

<p>"Not by a long sight. I know Japanese whose word is as good to me as
that of any white man. Of some of the big men and big firms you might
even say that their word is better than their bond; they'd rather be
generous than merely just, and the Japanese is far from being a piker.
There are lots of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>absolutely truthful Japanese just as there are lots
of whites who are thorough-going liars. But you might say that whereas
with the white man we take it for granted that he tells the truth until
we find out that he's a liar, with the Japanese one's inclined to take
it for granted that he's a liar until one learns the contrary. It may
be a blunt way of putting it, but it's the best I can do; and I think
that once the Japanese come to adopt our ethical point of view in this
respect, the same as they have adopted so many material things from us,
the greatest bar between the races will be removed.</p>

<p>"I should like to see it removed. I like the Japanese, and even if
I do realize that they don't like us, I can't greatly blame them. I
feel that we must appear arrogant to them, even when we are trying to
produce the feeling of quality&mdash;possibly even more so then&mdash;and so many
whites, especially among our own newcomers here, are beastly trying.
When I see our drummers and flappers, just off the ships, sitting
in trains, pointing at and commenting about Japanese men and women,
careless of the fact or not knowing that many of these people speak
foreign languages, I feel resentment myself, and I can understand what
the Japanese must feel. They have their faults and their scandals, but
are they worse on the whole than are ours? They treat us better here
than we treat them in America. I rave and rant at them as much as do
the rest of you; and yet, when it comes right down to the point, I like
them, and I wish them well, at least the people, the great masses, the
real nation, and I am sorry when I see the country shooting down-grade,
power going, wealth, industry, commerce, all going, I feel it is a
great pity. I want to see some great man come and lead them out of this
wilderness, some one like the great Meiji&mdash;but, where is he?"</p>

<p>"But what about the Prince Regent, then?" <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>Roberts was using his
opportunity for copy. "He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kittrick leaned forward to him, outstretched arm upsetting the liquor
glass before him. "So sorry, old man. Here, boy-san, quick, wipe up
this mess and get another glass for Mr. Roberts." He waited until the
boy had left them. "Really, Roberts, it seemed a rude thing to do, but
you simply must not talk about the Imperial House in front of these
boys, who like as not are in the pay of the Foreign Office or the
police. Possibly what you were going to say might have been all right,
but I was afraid to take the chance. Remember this is in many respects
the Land of the Free far more than our own United States. We can drink
what we please and have far more personal liberty in thousands of ways.
You can even cuss the government quite freely as long as you don't
preach Communism, or Sovietism, or that kind of rot; but, when it comes
to mention of the Imperial House, they stand for no nonsense. It's the
law of the land. It's safest to keep quiet."</p>

<p>The crowd in Peacock Alley was passing away, up the stairways to the
ballroom. The rest of the men followed; Kittrick and Roberts were alone
for the moment. "But just tell me this," the magazine man was noted
for his insistence. "What do you, from what you hear, think about it?
What are the chances, in your opinion, of the Prince Regent becoming a
second Meiji?"</p>

<p>"My dear man, I have no more idea about it than if I lived in Lima.
The pitifully few points we do know are hopeful. When he returned from
England, the police, according to the old rule, forbade cheering; but
the crowd cheered, anyway, for the first time in history, and it was
quite plain that the Prince Regent liked it. Then, a little later, when
the crowd at Kyoto broke through the cordons and came closer than had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
been ordained, he remained with it longer than the set time. The mayor
resigned, "took the responsibility" as they call it; but the point is
that the Prince Regent was immensely pleased.</p>

<p>"That's about all I know that's of significance. Pitifully meager,
isn't it? But the fact is that we know less of what is really going
on inside Tokyo palace walls than we do about the holy of holies
in Lhassa. What are the influences surrounding the ruler of Japan,
modern or reactionary, sixteenth century or twentieth century? It is
possible that the entire future of Japan, of the Far East, depends on
just that one thing&mdash;and yet we don't know a blessed thing about it,
I, the rest of the correspondents, any one, in fact. No one knows,
except the infinitely narrow and secretive circle of the highest
officials. The Prince Regent is seen at official functions, he sees
foreigners, entirely formally, quite occasionally, but outside of the
scant official announcements which give no real information at all, the
world knows nothing. When you think of our present-day news facilities,
cables, wireless, and the rest, it seems impossible, incredible, that
we shouldn't know a little, have some slight idea; but it remains, to
my mind at least, the biggest and the most fascinating mystery in the
world. If any country ever stood at the crossroads, if any country ever
needed a great man to lead it, that's Japan to-day. Will the Prince
Regent be a second Meiji?" He threw his hands wide. "Go and find out,
and you'll have one of the biggest stories of the year."</p>

<p>Kent came over to them. "I say, aren't you chaps coming upstairs?" They
went up together, to the ballroom where dancing had already begun, and
stood near the entrance watching the dancers.</p>

<p>"An odd scene, isn't it, this combination of East and West," commented
Roberts. "They actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> do seem graceful with their wonderful,
fanciful kimonos. Look at this girl just passing us. Can they really
dance?"</p>

<p>"Can a duck swim? That young lady is Miss Kimiko Suzuki, a special
friend of Kent's." Kittrick turned towards Kent. "Roberts is just
admiring your friend, Miss Kimiko&mdash;&mdash;" But Kent was not listening. He
had noticed Sylvia coming towards them and stepped forward to meet her.
"I was hoping to see you here. You know, I haven't seen you since that
night at Ikegami."</p>

<p>"I am just on my way to find some cool place." He followed her as she
went towards the stairway. "There's such a crush in here, and I am
rather tired, anyway."</p>

<p>They found a nook, balcony-like, discreetly tucked away in the
labyrinth of porticoes and passages, overhanging a court with a long
stone-set pool, whose jet-black, surface, lacquer-like, gave back
glimmering reflection of the stars. A few commonplaces; then they fell
silent. He reflected how odd it was that with this girl he obtained
complete satisfaction, the delicious feeling of absolute content,
superlative well-being, by merely being in her presence. Strains of
a waltz air came down to them, softened, etherealized by distance,
intertwined with the sound from a fountain plashing into the pool,
monotonous, hypnotic. She was leaning forward, cheek pillowed on one
hand, the other lying on the balustrade. He took it between his, held
it, without definite forethought, intention; somehow, it seemed just
the natural thing to do&mdash;and apparently it seemed so to her, too; she
let it rest there; merely looked at him softly, dreamily, hardly even
questioning. He knew that he would make love to her, would ask her to
marry him; ideas, words began to stir about, moving as if in a jumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
in his mind, trying to form themselves into phrases; but they refused
to shape themselves into tangible, definite sentences, and he felt
as if they were hardly necessary. They were in the perfect accord,
attunement, that rendered words superfluous. Of course, he must say
them some time, later in the evening, in a few minutes, perhaps, but
now, just now, he wished merely to sit like this, enjoying the sense
of their coming together, fusion, love, brought about perfectly,
disdainful of the crude medium of words.</p>

<p>But a mumble of voices could be heard among the pillars behind them. A
group passed, unseen, chattering, below. Hurried footsteps rang along
the tiles. He roused himself. "Sylvia&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The footsteps had come right up to them. "Here, Kent." It was Karsten;
of all men one would have thought that he at least would have had more
tact. But he rushed right up to them heedlessly, blunderingly. "Kent,
I've been hunting high and low for you. Kikuchi is waiting for you in
his auto at the side entrance to take you to the cable office. Big
news. Beat it. Don't bother about your hat or stick. I don't know what
it is, but it's big news. For God's sake, hurry," he was propelling
him down the hallway now. "I'll look after Miss Elliott for you in the
meanwhile; only move."</p>

<p>As he peered into the automobile standing at the side entrance, hands
seized him and dragged him in. "Kyubashi post-office, quick." It was
Kikuchi's voice giving directions to the chauffeur. "Kent, old man, I'm
giving you the beat of the year. Mito, the Premier, was assassinated
less than half an hour ago. I happened to be at my father's house when
they notified him. The cable office closes in fifteen minutes. The news
isn't out yet. You have a chance to beat the world. You did me a favor
with Kimiko-san, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>though probably you may not have realized it. I'm
trying to pay you back now."</p>

<p>"Mito, assassinated!" By the gods, the biggest story out of Japan since
the stabbing of Premier Hara. "But what are the details, Kikuchi? For
God's sake, tell me all you know."</p>

<p>"Nothing much is known yet, though it seems more sinister than the
Hara case. Mito was shot at the entrance of his official residence. A
volley, not a single shot, was fired through the board fence opposite.
They had made loopholes in it. They claim that there must have been
half a dozen of them, at least. No, no one has been caught. Yes, he's
dead as a doornail. That's all I know. Well, here we are. I'll wait for
you. Be quick."</p>

<p>His hand almost shook as he drafted his message, sending it at
urgent rates, by both wireless and cable to America, and by cable to
the London office, for luck. As he filed his stuff, he noted with
satisfaction that the clerks were getting ready to leave. His would be
the last message to get through that night. He had beaten the world.</p>

<p>He reëntered the hotel with the feeling of a conqueror, that he must
succeed in whatever he undertook. He would see Sylvia again presently,
just as soon as he had had a look in the ballroom, at the other
correspondents, to make sure that they were still in ignorance. He
sauntered up to Kittrick. He and Templeton were chatting idly. He
joined them. So far the news was not out. But as they stood there, he
noticed Butterfield in eager conversation with some Japanese. Now he
glanced about, left the hall hurriedly. Now the Japanese was talking to
Carew, editor of the <i>Japan American</i>, and Carew also suddenly became
active, febrile, as if he had received an electric shock. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hallo, Carew, what's the rush?" Kent caught him as he was hastening
past them. The editor glanced at his wrist-watch. "Past cable time, I
see. I might as well tell you. The Premier was assassinated less than
an hour ago. No, I have no details. I've got to hurry over to the shop.
I'm going to look after this make-up myself."</p>

<p>Safe, by George! Still he said nothing to the others. They would find
out soon enough that he had beaten them. But he wanted to bring his
triumph to her, Sylvia, a conqueror with the spoils of victory. But on
his way through Peacock Alley he met Karsten alone.</p>

<p>"Sorry, old man; I did the best I could to hold the lady, but I must
be getting old, losing my grip, or what? Anyway, she did not seem
to take to me as a substitute for you at all, acted sort of dumb,
moonstruck&mdash;you acted in a sort of a dazed way, too, for that matter,"
he whistled provokingly. "What do you intend to do now, anyway; the
night's still young."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, I think I'll go home. Did you hear what the news
was, about the assassination of Mito? Well, I scored a clean beat, as
you may know. I want to get home and gloat comfortably, to enjoy my
thoughts of my luck."</p>

<p>"Oh, what absolute liars newspapermen are." Karsten placed an arm
affectionately about his shoulders. "I can't let you insult my
intelligence by letting you think that I believe that. Kent, looking
at you, I have wondered whether when, in my sinful past, I have been
in love, I have looked so damned silly as that? It's wonderful; and
whether you deny it or not, I'm going to open a bottle of Cliquot with
you when we come home."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>"And now," Karsten was laughing across his glass, "I take it that I'm
not premature&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you are." Realization had suddenly flashed upon Kent that he had
nothing to celebrate; he had accomplished nothing, had been brought
no nearer a decision in his relationship with this girl. All this
feeling of certainty, this sense of having won her, was entirely
self-created, elation of auto-intoxication based on nothing tangible.
He became instantly irritated. "Drop this horse-play, Karsten. I don't
mind telling you I wish there were something to celebrate; but you
spoiled it all, rushing in as you did. If you hadn't, I might now have
known&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks, there's not a shadow of a doubt. Of course, I realized
it the moment I rushed in upon you two, just what was about to pass;
and after that, when I was alone with her after you had left, it
was plain enough. I used to think I knew something about women; I'm
certainly not mistaken now. And, Kent, old man, while I shall be
sorry to lose you, I'm glad this has come about. I'm getting to be
an old man. I have come to enjoy my sensations in respect to women
vicariously, by watching others, men and women whom I like, and you
won't mind my telling you that I've had not a little such vicarious
pleasure through you, enjoying, at second hand, your experiences,
what little you told me and what I might deduce and add thereto, with
these Japanese girls; and, old man, I'm honestly glad that you are now
finally coming to the end, and that it is not a Japanese girl." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" He had not entirely liked Karsten's confession, had sensed a
trace of annoyance that the other should thus have been watching him
critically, as if he were some one more or less impersonal, detached,
performing on a stage for his edification. But he forgot all this in
his astonishment at this last pronouncement&mdash;coming from Karsten of all
men. Why not a Japanese girl? "Why," he asked him the question. "Why
not a Japanese? I thought you liked the Japanese?"</p>

<p>"For myself, yes; for you, no," Karsten laughed, filled his pipe, lit
it. "You know there's a tremendous lot of talk and argument on the
question of mixed marriages. People say this and they say that, and
yet essentially I think the matter resolves itself into the question
of what a man seeks in marriage, what he expects in the woman he
joins himself with for life. It depends on whether a man loves with
his intellect or whether he loves with his senses. You and I furnish
good examples. You love essentially with your brain. Of course, you
enjoy brilliance and color, beauty, charm, and all that; you saw them
in these Japanese girls, and they fascinated you, entranced you. And
that was what I was a little afraid of, that you might succumb to it,
that you might suffer yourself to be overcome by this scintillating,
ephemeral fascination of the exotic; for it would have been fatal
for you; the newness is bound to wear off; and what you look for in
marriage, the thing in a woman which can hold you, is intellect. You
want beauty, charm, of course, but for you the great essential thing
is brains, a woman who can be a companion, a comrade, who can have all
your interests in common with you. That's the only kind of a relation
that may be lasting in your case.</p>

<p>"Now take my own. I love essentially with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> senses. Of course,
I want a woman with sense, intelligence; a fool would irritate me
immeasurably; I have no patience with fools; but I would be just as
intolerant with what we may call the 'trained intellect' in a woman
who was my constant companion. I enjoy that, greatly even, when I
chance across it in other women; but in the case of my own woman, the
one with me always, I want no arguments, no discussions in respect
to my own essential intellectual pursuits and interests. Bluntly, I
want to supply all the brains for the household. It's intolerant, of
course, but that's how I am. What I want is not a woman who'll discuss
politics, or Freud, or Relativity with me. I want one whom I may
enjoy as I do a picture, music, fragrance. Of course, you see that I
don't mean mere physical enjoyment&mdash;the man who marries for that is
obviously a fool&mdash;but what I'm trying to drive at is that I enjoy woman
companionship through esthetic impressions, through the visions and
dreams that her presence, her loveliness, her charm, her womanliness,
bring to me, not through ideas or debates. And that's why in my case I
felt that I might find happiness best with a Japanese, who might be all
of these things to me, playmate, doll, companion, picture&mdash;everything
but an encyclopedia or text-book on philosophy. And I had it, Kent. I
had all that with Jun-san&mdash;I have told you. My God, those were years
of happiness. But it was too perfect. I thought I had life all solved
for me, that I had finally gained serenity, peace; that I was about to
accomplish something worth while&mdash;and then," he picked up his glass,
smashed it deliberately into the brass bowl for pipe litter, "then to
have it all smashed, like that&mdash;and by my own son!"</p>

<p>"Your son," Kent leaned forward, hands gripping chair arms. "Your son!
You don't mean Mortimer?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's the only son I have, isn't he?" Karsten had been pacing the
floor; now he turned, facing Kent, glaring. "I didn't mean to tell you;
but now you know it. Of course, I mean Mortimer."</p>

<p>"But it's impossible, it's absurd, it's preposterous, Karsten, man;
you don't mean to say that you've been wrecking your life over such an
insane fever fancy as that?"</p>

<p>"Fancy, hell! It's good enough in you, Kent, to stick up for the boy,
to believe it impossible; but, hang it, man, I saw it with my own eyes."</p>

<p>"By the gods, Karsten, you lie." He had jumped up, flung the challenge
into his face, eyes flashing, lips parted.</p>

<p>"I don't take that from any man, Kent." Karsten's fist flung backwards
in swing for attack. Kent faced him, left arm on guard. For a moment
they stood facing each other, glaring, then Karsten's fist dropped, he
relaxed, flung wide his hands. "Oh, what's the use, Kent. I'm sorry. It
is good of you to stick up for the boy; but, I tell you, I know. Let us
drop this, old man. Finish. Let us have a drink and say no more about
it."</p>

<p>"No, hold on." Kent had dropped into his chair and sat there, chin
resting in cupped hand, the other stretched towards Karsten in a
gesture warding off interruption. "Karsten, you know I'm not trying
to probe into this just out of idle curiosity; but I have an idea. I
wonder&mdash;&mdash; Now I want you to tell me exactly, in every detail, just
what you did see, the whole thing."</p>

<p>"But what good can it do? Do you think I enjoy this? Oh, very well,
then," he shrugged his shoulders. "Since you seem so curiously set on
it, I'll tell you.</p>

<p>"It happened when Mortimer came to Japan to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> me for a few months
when he was through college, before he went to Europe. Of course, I
was living with Jun-san then, but he didn't know it. She was living
in her cottage, just as she is now. I'm sure he suspected nothing. Of
course, I couldn't have him suspect. It was easy enough. Then one night
I came home late, and sat in the garden for a while, and then I saw it.
They were both in her cottage. I could see their shadows against the
paper of the <i>shoji</i>, sharply cut, silhouetted as in a shadow play;
there was no room for doubt; and then I saw him advance and place his
arm about her neck, and the two heads melted into one. My God, wasn't
that enough! Do you think I would want to wait and see more, to stand
passively and contemplate a love scene between her, my woman, who was
as much wife to me as if we had gone through a thousand ceremonials,
and my son, my own son? No, I ran out there into the temple grounds.
I sat down and I thought; and I walked up and down, and thoughts, and
ideas, and every sort of inspiration of madness passed in and out of
my mind. One moment I wanted to rush in and confront them, tear them
apart, throw them out, humiliate them, kill her. I learned that night
what it was to be mad, crazy, insane. I wanted to do a thousand things,
and at the same time I felt utterly helpless, that there was nothing
I could do. In my imagination I could see them, Jun-san and Mortimer,
my love and my son, in each other's arms, kissing, embracing. But
what could I do? Surely I couldn't rush in and say, 'Here, Mortimer,
that's my woman you have stolen.' The whole thing was impossible, a
sardonically grotesque masque contrived for my utter humiliation by
some demoniacal, superbly malicious fate. I even worked myself up
to believing, or at least half believing, that this was a sort of
retribution, punishment for my irregularities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> for my fool play with
women in the past, just as our Puritan forefathers might have done.
Yes, I was on the verge of being crazy, actually, pathologically
insane, that night. But I came finally to a conclusion, the only
logical conclusion&mdash;there was nothing for me to say or do; it simply
marked the end with me for women in my life. So in the early morning
I sneaked to my room; and a few weeks later Mortimer sailed for San
Francisco; and I never said a word to him, or to Jun-san. So there you
are. You see how it is. As our Japanese friends say, <i>shikataganai</i>; it
can't be helped."</p>

<p>"And that was all you ever saw?" Kent's voice had become calmly cold,
inquisitorial. "So that was all?"</p>

<p>"My God, wasn't that enough!" Karsten flung it at him irritatedly.
"What more could you want? Did you expect me to play the rôle of spy
on my son and my&mdash;&mdash;? Honestly, now, you seem to have become absurdly
dense."</p>

<p>But Kent had come up to him and was shaking him, laughing nervously
after the fashion of one who has passed into the trembling relief of
reaction after excitation of nervous strain. "Oh, Karsten-san, you big
damn fool, with your pride of intellect and finesse of reasoning and
all that; how much better it would have been for you if you had only
reacted as would have a sailor, or a butcher, or a coal-heaver, if you
had jumped in and had had it out on the spot. Now listen. I have the
whole explanation. I can show you what an absurd, blundering fool you
have been all these years&mdash;and I myself, here I've been going about
with the key to the whole story, and I have seen how it was between
Jun-san and you, and still I've never had the sense to tell you. What
fools we are, all of us. Now listen&mdash;&mdash; </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"On that night, the night all this happened, Mortimer had been to a
cinema show, had he not?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. As a matter of fact, he had; but what of that?"
Karsten had caught the infection of excitement, suspense at impending
revealment. His fingers were drumming on the table. "Don't sit there
as if you were about to drag a rabbit out of a hat. Get down to
essentials."</p>

<p>"Easy. That is essential. It all hinges on that. Mortimer had been to
see one of those American films that had been censored by the police.
He told me about it, after he had returned to San Francisco and was
telling me about Japan. He thought it amusing, that just as the picture
reached the climax, the point where the heroine, whoever she may have
been, fell into the arms of the hero, there came a blur, and, presto,
they were again six feet apart. The censor had cut out the kissing
scene. As I say, he thought it intensely funny, the idea of an entire
nation being kept from knowledge of kissing by a censor. And it worked,
he told me. 'They really don't know what kissing is,' he said. For the
idea had intrigued him. He had wondered; and when he came home and he
happened to be telling about it to a pretty servant&mdash;that's what threw
me off, his speaking of Jun-san as a servant; though, of course, I see
now that that's how he must naturally have looked upon her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the good Lord's sake, man, don't babble so," the rat-tat-tat of
Karsten's fingers seemed to crackle and snap like electricity. "Get to
the point."</p>

<p>"I am. Keep quiet. Let me think, won't you? So it occurred to him that
here was a chance where he might find out for himself, experiment.
Nothing to get excited about, Karsten. We've both done as much. So
he kept coming closer to her; just mischief, you know. It was plain
she suspected nothing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> kind, he told me. He got his arm about
her neck. She didn't move. She was utterly astounded, struck aghast,
transfixed in surprise. And then, when she did move, as he brought his
lips close to her mouth, she didn't struggle, she didn't cuff his ears
after Western fashion. She just placed her hands on his wrists and
looked at him. It must have been impressive. He told me that he felt a
greater sense of rebuff, of being ashamed of himself, than if she had
struck him. And that's how he left her. That was all that happened. And
here you've let that woman suffer for years, Karsten, and I never had
the sense to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Karsten had strode past him, was not listening. He flung open the
sliding door at the head of the stairway. "Jun-san," he was calling
down into the dimness below. "Jun-san, come, come here right away."</p>

<p>In her haste even the softness of her <i>zori</i> made a clatter on the
stairs. She entered, breathless, wide-eyed in anxiety at the sudden
call, stood astounded, staring at Karsten who was standing&mdash;arms
stretched towards her.</p>

<p>Kent edged towards the door. They paid no attention to him. She was
still standing there, trembling, lips parted, unable to believe. Now
he had almost gained the door. It seemed unreal, like a theatrical
situation, these two, in their trembling intensity.</p>

<p>"Erik-san, oh, Erik-san!" She was in Karsten's arms now, high
hair-dress against his shoulder. As he slid the partition shut, Kent
caught a glimpse of the man's head bending down towards her. It was
dramatic, affecting. He caught his breath sharply, blinked his eyes,
and at the same time the thought came to him, frivolously erratic&mdash;it
was just like the cinema film; he had cut the picture at the very most
intense moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p>He sat up in bed in bewildered wonder whether it had been an actual
sound, an explosion, that had awakened him, or whether it had been some
particularly realistic bit of dream. Still, there was a peculiarly
dry, rattling clatter, something like hail&mdash;and yet the sun was
shining&mdash;just as he was trying to shake himself thoroughly awake, the
sound ceased abruptly.</p>

<p>As he swung himself out of bed, Karsten hurried in. "Hallo, time to get
busy, Kent. It has broken loose, the revolution, riot, or whatever it
is, shooting, burning. That was machine-gun fire we just heard, from
the Aoyama barracks, I take it. Breakfast will be ready for you when
you have dressed. You had better make a meal before you start; you're
likely to have a strenuous day."</p>

<p>It was difficult to take time for eating, but Karsten insisted. "Won't
you come along?" asked Kent. "You should see the excitement." But
Karsten shook his head, laughed. "No, to-day, I'm staying home, even if
they burn down all of Tokyo." He smiled to Jun-san. She came over to
him and placed her hand on his shoulder. Happiness, radiated over these
two, made them look younger, an odd appearance of newness, as if they
had been refurbished, brightened. A flash of envious admiration came to
Kent; after all, though modern life smiled at romance, it was the thing
that mattered, woman, affection between the sexes, the one ingredient
that could vitalize humdrum existence with the color, the play and
sparkle of joy of living. From a distance came the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>reverberation of
a dull boom; from somewhere near the center of the city a great smoke
cloud shot skywards, mushroomed in the still air, dissipated slowly
into a thin pall of bluish haze.</p>

<p>He ran into the street. It seemed like a holiday, with the absence of
the usual bustle of business. Here and there groups of people, mostly
women, chattered excitedly, with a frightened and yet fascinated look
on their faces. It reminded him of the aspect the neighborhood took on
when there was a fire in the quarter. The street cars were not running.
A detachment of police passed him, about a hundred of them, running
with their peculiar stiff trot, each with a gloved hand clamped on his
short sword, in a long double file.</p>

<p>As he came near the square at Toranomon, he ran into a line of
infantrymen, resting stolidly on their rifles, keeping clear the wide
space behind them, the quarter containing the Diet building, Foreign
Office, the Kasumigaseki Palace and, farther back, the General Staff
headquarters. He made his way along a side street hurriedly, avoiding
the crowds which had gathered here and there, wherever temple grounds
or square afforded a convenient space. There was not so much excitement
as he had expected, rather an air of expectancy; they did not appear
like people who were engaged at this moment in overthrowing their
overlords; rather they seemed eager for the staging of some event which
they knew was about to happen, as if they were waiting for a show of
daylight fireworks. Still, here and there might be seen small groups
of men who seemed to have a definite objective, who were intent on
some certain purpose, on going somewhere. It was significant that they
all, even the more stolid ones, ran, or walked, or drifted in the same
general direction,&mdash;towards the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>government building quarter stretching
from the central police station at Hibiya to the War Office in a long
curve following the outer palace moat and centering on the wide street
running from the palace gate at Sakuradamon, near which lay the nerve
centers of the Government, the Navy, War and Judiciary buildings, the
Diet quarters, and the rest.</p>

<p>The whole movement was too vast, too intangible, covered too much
ground to make it possible to handle the story single-handed. They
would know more at the <i>Japan American</i> Office. He found Carew there,
tired-eyed, helping himself to hot, black coffee from a thermos bottle.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Kent," he stretched himself. "Hell, isn't it? Here it is, the
big story, the outbreak that we have all been expecting and waiting
for for years, the demolishment of the last stronghold in the world of
militarism in its old form, perhaps; and here I am, almost idle. There
is news popping every minute, big stuff, and there isn't a thing to
do with it. The boys are out covering the story as best they can, but
what's the use? We can't get out a paper. There is no power for the
machines, and, anyway, I have no linotype men, no press crew. You might
as well take it easy, too. Tokyo is isolated as far as messages are
concerned. The wires are down everywhere. They say the bridges are down
on all sides of the city. Even if they weren't, they would not take
cable messages, of course. I tried to send one of the boys to Yokohama,
hoping he might get a message out by wireless from some steamer, but
he just came back. The Kawasaki bridge has been blown up, one span at
least, and the military are guarding it and won't let any one pass. Go
out and enjoy yourself looking about, but you won't get any news out of
here to-day, anyway." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what do you make of it?" Carew's stoicism irritated him. "What do
you know about it? Is it The Revolution?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Carew shrugged his shoulders. "Call it anything you
please, revolution, riot, overthrow. It is the simultaneous uprising
of all the lower classes, the poorer classes, the working classes.
It is the explosion of the discontent that has been accumulating for
years. It reminds me of a drift of snow that has been growing bigger
and bigger, overhanging some steep slope, waiting but for some impetus
to start it off. The Mito assassination started it; it is on the way,
gathering force every minute, an avalanche that gains growth from
the snow that is waiting to add its volume as it rushes onwards. The
question now is merely whether the Government can hold it; if the
troops will stick by it. That'll tell the whole story."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea how far this is a concerted movement, a planned
general movement? Have you gotten anything from the outside?"</p>

<p>"Sure it is part of a general plan to some extent." Carew handed him
a sheaf of Nippon Dempo news service flimsies. "These kept coming in
until early this morning when everything suddenly stopped. You see how,
the moment the news of the Mito assassination came out, hell broke
loose in various places. Peasants from one end of Japan to the other,
tenant farmers, who have been clamoring at the landlords on account
of exorbitant rents, have been burning village offices and landlords'
houses. At the same time came strikes, rioting, violence in all the
industrial centers,&mdash;Osaka, Kobe, Nogoya. At first, when the news began
to trickle in last night, I thought it was just like the rice riots
in 1918, with breaking of some windows and wrecking of some office
buildings and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>warehouses. But it's bigger. It's a sight bigger. I
fancy no one knows how big it will grow before it stops, or where it
will stop. Go take a look about town, and you'll see they've done a lot
of damage already.</p>

<p>"We had a small riot right here a couple of hours ago. I've known right
along that one of the linotype men is a Socialist leader of sorts;
at least, the police have always come and locked him up whenever the
suffrage bill or anything like that came up in the Diet. But when they
came early this morning as per usual, some three or four of them,
they set upon them, all the printers. They beat the devil out of the
policemen and then they beat it. I fancy that's characteristic of the
whole situation all over Japan. The worm is turning."</p>

<p>Kent went on to his office a few blocks away. Ishii was there, restless
with excitement. "I've been waiting for you, Kent-san. I have a message
for you. She came about an hour ago, Adachi-san. She says that if you
want to see the best part of the excitement, come to Sakuradamon.
She'll probably be there."</p>

<p>Adachi-san! It was like a shock to have her suddenly injected into
his life again after all these months. A short time ago, when she had
vanished, this news would have caused his heart to beat high with
excitement, would have sent him flying to find her&mdash;but now, even
though he did feel expectancy at seeing her again, curiosity to learn
why she had disappeared, where she had been, the predominant feeling
was one of uneasiness. That incident, that bit of romance, had been
delightful, pungently sweet when thought of as just that, a delectable,
charming interlude in the humdrum course of existence; but that was
just its main charm, what gave it the subtle flavor of a fanciful
dream, its evanescence, the very fact that it had never crystallized
into a more lasting, definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> relationship. It had faded out of his
life now; what he could treasure as a memory, a whimsical recollection,
might be but vitiated, rendered drab and prosaic, should he allow its
reality to inject itself, intrudingly, into his life. And then, of
course, over and above it all, there was Sylvia.</p>

<p>"We had better go right now." Ishii was nervously eager. "You had
better wear your police badge where it can be seen, so we can get
through the lines."</p>

<p>"All right, I'm coming." He fastened his police badge, a disk of wood
bearing the magic formula which allowed him to pass police cordons, on
a string about his neck. Of course, he must see her. After all, it was
pathetic, her thinking of him in the midst of all this excitement. He
wondered how much she really had to do with it all.</p>

<p>As they approached Hibiya Park the crowds became more dense. He
had to display his badge repeatedly to get past lines of police.
Excitement was more evident now, and yet the city seemed oddly quiet.
He realized that it was the absence of the usual noise of traffic, roar
of elevated trains, clatter of street cars. The entire voice of the
city had changed; the volume of sound from hundreds of thousands of
humans, shuffling along in clacking <i>geta</i>, talking, shouting, making
an entirely new sound, live, electric, ominous as contrasted with the
usual mechanical rattle.</p>

<p>Just in front of the park the police lines were the most solid,
thousands of officers backed by mounted gendarmes. They would not let
him pass, shrugged shoulders as he tried to argue with them, showing
his pass. He worked his way along the line towards the main entrance,
hoping to find some opening. He found a young official, pleasantly
courteous, who seemed inclined to listen. Suddenly, as he argued, a
dull roar sounded behind him, to his right; a gust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> of wind, as if a
giant had blown a gigantic breath over him and the rest of the crowd.
The masses behind him surged forward irresistibly. He noted that the
mouth of the young officer had opened, eyes popping, staring as if some
astounding, incredible sight had just appeared. As the crowd pushed
on, carrying him and the police line before it, he managed to turn
and look over the heads of the frantic people milling all about him.
As he was borne on, through the entrance into the park, he caught a
glimpse of the great central police station to the right behind him.
The entire corner was gone, leaving exposed, doll-house rooms in the
interior beyond. The usually meticulous bronze figure of some noted
police official had been knocked askew by the débris into an absurdly
incongruous drunken attitude. Fine dust from the explosion began to
settle over them. The crowds, frantically insistent on getting away,
had broken through the police lines on all sides, along the broad
road between Hibiya Park and the outer moat, and, beyond that, across
Babasakimon bridge, into the great space between the inner and outer
palace moats, surging towards Sakuradamon. But here in Hibiya Park the
police were getting the crowd in hand again, assisted by gendarmes and
soldiers who had come from the other side of the square. The mounted
men rode their horses right into the crowds; sabers were used freely.
The soldiers seemed unenthusiastic, apathetic. Kent noticed that they
belonged to some infantry regiment up in the fifties; probably they
were country recruits, more in sympathy with the mob than against it.
But the others, the police and the gendarmes, were laboring under
hysterical excitement. They had always seemed absurd to him, these
tiny-looking swords, but quite evidently they were dangerous weapons,
viciously sharpened. Some of the superior officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> particularly
appeared to have become entirely beside themselves, eyes bloodshot,
mouths foaming, literally crazed for the moment, maniacs insane with
blood lust.</p>

<p>Kent managed to avoid them by taking the smaller paths leading through
shrubbery. The police were all busy raging at the mob, and the
soldiers, seeing his police emblem, shrugged shoulders and let him
pass. As he worked over towards the other side of the park, in the
direction of the navy wireless tower, he became aware of a feeling
of emptiness, as if the space, the atmosphere rather, had in some
strange way changed, as if it were lighter, more spacious. There was a
peculiar acrid tang in the air; he sniffed; yes, that was smoke rising
there over the trees. He climbed a low knoll, usually a favorite place
for lovers, with a summerhouse surrounded by azaleas. Ah, that was
it; where the Diet building had stood, a barn-like, wood and stucco
structure, was now no building at all; only smoldering heaps of débris.
He obtained a moment's amusement by noticing that the cordons of police
and soldiers which had been guarding the Diet all these months were
still there, on all four sides of the great block, solemnly guarding
the smoking ashes.</p>

<p>He swerved to the right, managed to get to the street alongside the
outer moat just ahead of the crowd which had broken through the police
lines down by the central station. Here, inside the space containing
the most important government buildings, were scattered only small
detachments of police and soldiers, who did not attempt to face the
mob; but beyond, up on the high ground by the War Office and the
General Staff headquarters, were sounding bugle calls. Evidently troops
were being summoned to form new cordons to take the places of those
which had been broken.</p>

<p>By this time he was almost running. He must get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> as far as possible
into this inner area before new lines were formed. Evidently the same
thought possessed the mobs racing behind him. They were surprisingly
silent; the predominating sound was the vast volume of clatter made by
tens of thousands of wooden <i>geta</i>. Just as he was about to pass into
the square facing, on its right, the Sakuradamon palace entrance and to
the left a great empty lot above which rose the General Staff building,
he heard his name being called. "Here, Kent-san. Here I am."</p>

<p>There she was, Sadako-san, with a small group of others, at a vantage
point formed by the small space surrounding the pedestal of a statue of
a frock-coated gentleman in bronze, set in a corner of the Judiciary
building grounds. There were two or three other girls and about a dozen
men. He noticed the professor who had been in jail on account of his
writings about Kropotkin.</p>

<p>She had been right in picking this point as the center of events.
Already they were beginning to concentrate on this spot from all sides,
the crowd coming along the Hibiya Park road and that flowing across
the space from Babasakimon reinforced by the student contingent from
Kanda and the laborers from Asakusa and Uyeno, and even from across the
Sumida River, from Honjo and Fukagawa. And apparently they were trying
to come on from the other side of the city, too. Up on the higher
ground, in the direction of the Sanno-dai Temple grounds, a hilly park
often used for demonstrations, came sound of musketry, volley firing.
Bugles still sounded about the General Staff headquarters grounds
and, behind that, on the hill crowned by the War Office. Bugles also
began to sound from across the moat, inside the inner palace grounds.
Still, oddly, there was no sight of soldiers or police; the crowds
continued to surge on into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> square, gradually filling it. On the
other side the multitude was evidently being kept in check by some
cordon which they could not see, at Toranomon probably. A few small
groups, individual figures here and there, evidently Foreign Office
officials or men from the Italian or Russian embassies close by, were
moving along rapidly, evidently to see the excitement. Presently Kent
saw Kikuchi. He shouted to him, managed to attract his attention. As
he joined their group, Kent noticed a stir among the others, frowns,
whispers, then shoulder shrugs; but no protest was made.</p>

<p>But he wanted to see Sadako-san, to have a few words with her, at
least. He managed to draw her aside a little, sheltered against the
pedestal of the statue. "Sadako-san, where have you been? That wasn't
the right thing to do, to run away from me like that. You know,
I've&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Kent-san, you must not think that that was what I asked you to
come here for, to talk nonsense, on a day like this&mdash;no, not nonsense,
forgive me. I didn't mean that. We'll talk about&mdash;about these other
things some other time&mdash;yes, I promise&mdash;but to-day; don't you see, this
is the day we have all been waiting for so long, the day marking the
birth of a new Japan, when the people of Japan shall break down the
rule of the tyrants, of the wicked, old anachronists over there," she
pointed across the square to the gray, copper-roofed building of the
General Staff. "That's why I asked you to come here, to this spot; for
this is where history is to be made to-day."</p>

<p>It flashed on him that she made a picture as she stood there, exquisite
in her soft-tinted kimono, eyes flashing, cheeks flushed. She seemed
as if she might be emblematic, a figure representative of the new
Japanese idealism, standing side by side with this bronze frock-coated
individual, a nice old respectable <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>bureaucrat no doubt, whoever he
might be; the two, the breathing, pulsating girl and the cold, stiff
bronze man, symbolic of Japan of to-day, the contrast. Still, why did
she insist on taking part in this mad medley of mob passion? How much
happier she would be&mdash;&mdash; Recollection came to him of some of their
excursions together. But, of course, that could be no longer. The
thought came to him suddenly&mdash;it was fortunate that she had refused to
discuss personal topics. That was just like him, saying things without
thinking. He had not intended to recall their affair, matters of
affection; still, of course, he could see now how it must have seemed
to her that he was trying to do so.</p>

<p>The crowd kept surging into the square, which was gradually filling.
It began to become monotonous; nothing happened; it did not look as if
anything was even about to happen; one became impatient, disappointed
with the sense of constantly baffled expectation. Evidently the
"revolution" was about to fizzle and splutter into extinction without
dramatic dénouement. Did it have any intention whatever, this mob? What
was the idea of the whole thing? "What is going to happen, Sadako-san?
What are you people going to do? Is all this disturbance throughout
Japan a planned, concerted movement, or is it just accidental,
spontaneous outbreaks caused by the death of the Premier?"</p>

<p>"Both, in a way." She showed her pleasure at being able to instruct
him. "We have been waiting for many months for this to happen, we
radicals, thousands of us, scattered through all of Japan. Everywhere
where there was dissatisfaction, among the tenant farmers in all the
country districts, among the industrial laborers and all the other poor
people in the cities, in fact, everywhere in Japan we had our leaders,
a few here and a few there; only a few were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> needed in each place;
conditions have made the people, the whole nation almost, ready to
strike if only some one gave a start. They all knew, we all knew, that
some day the great event would occur which would be the signal for our
men to lead revolts throughout Japan. We all knew that it would happen
some day, to-morrow, in a month, in a year, but when we didn't know, or
possibly only the very few leaders. The police knew, too, that it would
happen sometime; but that was just what baffled them; what prevented
them from making an end to the business, the utter uncertainty of it
all. They could not keep all of us, the thousands and thousands on
their suspect lists, locked up all the time. So we all waited, we and
the police, for the event that would be the signal, and when they
killed that poor fool Mito, we all knew that the time had come. But the
police could not move fast enough. Do you know that all bridges and
wires are down all about Tokyo? They have had to send their best troops
to Korea and Manchuria for their schemes there. They couldn't depend
on most of the army for imperialist schemes, ever since the Siberian
scandal. So now there is in Tokyo only the First Regiment, the Imperial
Guards, who'll be loyal to the General Staff. And do you think that
they can stop us?" She stretched her hand out towards the crowding
thousands in the square before them. "Do you think one regiment can
stop them?"</p>

<p>"But what is it that you are going to do? Why are all these people
coming here? What's the big purpose?"</p>

<p>"Why, overthrow, of course." She almost shouted in her impatience.
"We shall turn them out, the General Staff, the bureaucrats; then we
shall&mdash;anyway, we shall overthrow the Government."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders wearily. Always, in beer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> hall, or public
square, or radical magazine, these students, professors, theorists,
revolutionists, always ranting about the "overthrow" without an
idea of what must follow. Impatience overcame him. It all seemed so
futile, silly, even the big events, the assassination of the Premier,
the burning of the Diet building and the rest, purposeless, childish
destruction, leading nowhere.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you do overthrow it all, what then? Do you want to be
like Russia?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Russia then?" The voice, masculine, faintly
familiar, came from right behind him. He turned resentfully. Who the
devil could this be, eavesdropping? It was Lüttich. He had seen the
Russian only a few times since the days when they were fellow-travelers
on the <i>Tenyo Maru</i>. He had supposed that he was teaching the
violin, dancing, French and other polite accomplishments to the
aristocracy. What was he doing here, evidently hand in glove with the
revolutionists? And what the devil business had he to butt in on them?</p>

<p>"The last time I talked politics with you, Lüttich," he spoke with
studied sarcasm, that the others might hear, "you seemed to have lots
to say against the present government of Russia."</p>

<p>"Of course," the other laughed scornfully. "What chance do you think a
Russian would have living in Japan unless he sang just that tune? But,
good Lord, man, did you really think that I'd content myself with that,
with being a dancing master, and in these times. These are the times to
live in, Kent. Think of it, a few years ago, Petrograd, and now here,
to-day, Tokyo! And to have a hand in it all! Did you see the police
station, Kent-san? What did you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I think of&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look, listen," she had gripped his arm. Across the square, on the hill
of the General Staff building, something was in motion. The Kropotkin
professor had a field glass which was being passed round. Kent, in
his turn, caught a glimpse of the scene in front of the building, a
solitary figure in the middle, and lower down, in front of it, files of
soldiers. He passed the glass on to Kikuchi.</p>

<p>"My God, Kent-san," Kikuchi handed it back to him. "Take another look.
Don't you see, it's him, the Devil himself, General Matsu, chief of the
General Staff."</p>

<p>From the top of the hill the bugle sounded again. A roar, explosions
from all sides, flashes from the other side of the moat, from the
ramparts of the palace grounds, from the top of the hill. Then,
abruptly, a moment of silence, of bewilderment, sudden occurrence and
sudden cessation of the sound having a theatrical effect, as if a
pianist had finished a rather tedious composition with a sudden sweep
of hand crashing across the full stretch of bass octaves. It stunned
them, and the crowd stood dumb, numbed, unbelieving. Then it was as if
at precisely the same instant the full meaning of what had happened
came to all, a revelation of despair; they were surrounded, troops
on all sides, hemmed them in, tens of thousands. From all sides they
crowded, milling against the center, seeking escape. Kent pushed the
girl before him, up towards the top of the pedestal, he and the rest
climbing up its terraced sides to avoid the sea of humanity surging
frantically about them. Whimsically, there came to his mind a picture
from the Doré Bible, a picture of the flood, a group of humans and
animals seeking on an isolated rocky peak escape from the rising waters.</p>

<p>"Damn them, they have some sense yet, these <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>militarists," there was a
note of admiration in the voice of the Russian. "Here they have managed
to trap the best part of the country's radical leaders, half of them at
least. I wonder if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>From the hill top came the notes of the bugle, clear, unfaltering, like
a maneuver call. Immediately another crash of rifles, just one volley.
They were shooting more accurately this time, or the officers were
compelling the men to do so. All along the edges of the mob they were
falling, men and women, children even, rolling down the steep slopes
into the moat, or falling under the feet of the mass, milling about,
stampeded, driven in upon itself from all sides. Now the multitude had
found its voice, but it was inarticulate, shrieks, cries and groans
mingling into a vast volume of sound, meaningless, inhuman.</p>

<p>Another half minute. Again the bugle, followed by a single volley.
Another half minute, another volley. The crowd was like insane
creatures, those at the edges fighting their way in, those in the
middle struggling frantically to escape, and, every thirty seconds, the
bugle call, and the single sharp volley, with military precision, from
all sides.</p>

<p>"I didn't think they had it in them, that they had that much
imagination," there was open admiration in the Russian's tone now.
"Don't you see it, Kent-san, the devilish cleverness of it all. It's
not the shooting that's the worst; it's the suspense, the waiting, the
bugle call and the knowledge of the death that comes with it. That's
what they will remember to their dying day, all those who escape, if
they let any one escape. That'll take the heart out of them. Such is
life, the life of a revolutionist, Kent-san. They're setting us back
ten years to-day, damn them, but we'll get them in the end."</p>

<p>Time had come for the next bugle call. It seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> overdue, a longer
interval than before. They almost wanted it to come, to have it over
with. Surely the interval was long. They began to glance about, at one
another. Was it possible? Face peered anxiously into face, each seeking
to read confirmation of his own hope. Had the killing really ceased, or
was this but another refinement of cruelty?</p>

<p>"No, it's over; they've finished; the soldiers are retiring." It was
the professor with the field glass. At the same time there came from
in front of them, like a ripple of sound passing rapidly, quaveringly,
through the mob, a whisper, then the rumor spoken aloud but in the
doubting tone of unbelief; finally in shouts: "The Prince Regent, the
Prince Regent. He stopped it. He told the militarists that he would not
have them kill His people. His people. The Prince Regent!"</p>

<p>The emotions of the crowds were still too conflicting to allow definite
united form of expression, joy, sorrow, relief. The cries of the dying
and wounded became audible now to the individuals, who until this had
been concerned only with their own frantic fears, listening for the
death-signaling bugle. Evidently the cordons about Hibiya had been
withdrawn, for the crowd became suddenly augmented. New arrivals who
had not been set trembling by suspense of expectation of death, saw the
dead, raised their hands in wrath. Shouts for vengeance, cries from the
wounded, trembling hysteria of those who had escaped the debacle all
mingled in a chaos of confusion of sound, of movement, of minds.</p>

<p>"Now's the time, you fools," Kent heard the Russian's hoarse whisper to
those about him. "In this moment you win or lose the revolution. All
that's needed now is a leader. Come on, lead them, demolish the General
Staff. Here, take some of these." Kent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> caught a glimpse of dark
lemon-shaped objects, with crisscross furrows, as they passed from hand
to hand. "I don't suppose you want one," he grinned to Kent. "You don't
know how much history there may be crammed into one of these little
things. Anyway, come along."</p>

<p>The others had already started, making their way through the mob. The
professors and the rest, Sadako-san, Ishii, even Kikuchi. He caught the
young diplomat's arm. "What the devil are you doing in this, Kikuchi?
You had better get back to the Foreign Office where you belong."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Kent, don't be a fool," the young fellow's face
was ecstatic, eyes brilliantly flashing. "Don't you see it, Kent? He
is with us, the Prince Regent, with the people. He must be at the
Kasumigaseki Palace, right across the way from the General Staff
building. He must have seen with his own eyes almost, and he stopped
them. He is with us, the people; what in hell does it matter whether we
be Foreign Office mannikins or proletariat; we all are the people of
Japan, the nation, and we all want just that one thing, the overthrow
of the militarists and of the bureaucrats."</p>

<p>They had reached the edge of the mob at the foot of the wide driveway
leading to the General Staff building. Most of the soldiers had
disappeared; only a thin cordon guarded the approach. Behind them,
scattered in the throng, they could hear voices of leaders shouting.
"To the General Staff; this way; throw them out; to the General Staff!"
The cry was taken up; it became a roar; again the mob took common
direction. Presently they found themselves in the front rank, pressed
steadily forwards by the urge of the multitude behind them. Kent was
pushed upwards with the rest of the group, Sadako-san,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> Kikuchi, Ishii,
Lüttich and the others, closer and closer to the line of soldiers,
being driven steadily nearer the extended bayonet points. The officer
in charge, a captain, Prussian-mustached, scowling at the advancing
crowd, was directly in front of them. They could see him biting
his lips, finger nervously playing about his automatic, suspense,
indecision, plainly written on his face. A stone thrown by some one in
the crowd whizzed past him. Kent heard him bark out something, some
order; instantly the rifles of the soldiers had leaped into position at
their shoulders. By the gods, they were about to fire!</p>

<p>Those in the front rank of the mob tried to push backwards, but were
held fast by those behind. Instinctively Kent placed his arm about
Sadako, glaring up at the soldiers. Another gruff military order was
barked out, hoarse, unintelligible. The rifles came to rest. The
soldiers began to retreat slowly. "That was Matsu himself gave that
order." Kent heard the excited whisper of Kikuchi right in his ear.
"That's one thing about these militarists, at least. They obey orders.
Look, there he is."</p>

<p>He had come forward, an old man in field uniform with a single great
silver decoration, almost as large as a saucer, below his breast. He
was waving back, impatiently, other officers who evidently wished to
stay with him, barked out some command to them imperiously. Then he
turned, facing the mob, white-haired head erect, hand on sword hilt,
silent, proud, impressive.</p>

<p>"By the gods, they are no cowards, anyway, these militarists," Kent
flung the words back over his shoulder to Kikuchi. "One man against a
nation."</p>

<p>"He accepts the responsibility. What else can he do?" The old Japanese
formula, the gentleman's creed. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>Those in the front rank tried to hold back, impressed, awed at this
solitary old man, glaring at them defiantly through steel-rimmed
spectacles. But those behind pressed on. Stones began to fly; suddenly
a shot sounded from the right. The general slumped into a heap; he
tried to raise one hand, collapsed, was quiet.</p>

<p>The captain of the cordon swung about, facing the crowd, face
twitching, teeth bared like a snarling beast. Eyes popping, he waved
his heavy automatic at those in front, yelling at them maniacally.
"Cowards, scum, animals." He was plainly entirely mad. "Yes, and women
too; take that!"</p>

<p>The gun spat directly at Sadako, within a couple of feet of her breast.
Kent felt her become limp suddenly in his arm. As he clung to her, he
sensed something hard worming itself in from behind between him and the
girl. Damn it! He struggled for room in the mob. A dull roar of sound,
powerful, stunned him as if an impact had suddenly pressed against his
side. Dazedly, as through a blur, he saw the figure of the captain reel
backwards, pistol sagging, then tumbling into a heap. A roar went up
from the mob behind them. The surge forward became insistent. A few
of them, Kent, Kikuchi, Ishii, managed to hold up the girl, as the
multitude rushed on past them.</p>

<p>"Here, to the left." Kikuchi was breaking a way. "Let us bring her to
my office. We can take her in through the side gate just across the
way."</p>

<p>They battled their way through the mob slowly, desperately. From above
came the roar of sound, clamor of the crowd, explosions. Just as they
were about to reach the side gate, Lüttich appeared, hatless, wild-eyed.</p>

<p>"Here, there's not time for this." He caught the shoulder of one of the
Japanese, a burly labor leader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> "They have fired the General Staff
building; now is the time for a clean sweep. Come on, help lead them to
the palace, the Emperor's palace."</p>

<p>"The palace!" The man stared at the Russian, mouth open, dumbfounded.
"The Emperor!" Then, as realization suddenly dawned on him, he crashed
his fist into the other's face. "Fool, beast!"</p>

<p>The Russian stepped back, bumped into Kent. In his astonishment he did
not seem to notice the physical pain. "And that's the crowd I've been
making bombs for; can you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was swept away by the throng. They managed to gain the Foreign
Office grounds, carried the girl to Kikuchi's office and placed her on
a lounge. Kent pulled away the <i>eri</i> neckband and the upper part of
the kimono. There it was, in the left breast, blue-black against the
whiteness, a small spot, a few drops of blood. She seemed unconscious,
groaned but a little.</p>

<p>"Here, Ishii." Kikuchi took charge. "There should be a doctor at the
American Embassy on a day like this. Get out through the entrance on
the other side, across the tennis court and through Sannencho Lane. If
any one stops you, show them this Foreign Office seal on the envelope.
Here," he turned to Kent. "Sign this. I'm asking them to send a doctor
over here."</p>

<p>Apparently all the Foreign Office people had gathered in the main
building. In this wing it was quiet, but with a roaring background of
sound, as of surf pounding on rocks, the clamor of the mob outside. The
girl stirred, opened her eyes. "Hugh-san," her hand faltered towards
him. "It's good you're here, Hugh-san."</p>

<p>"What's that; so she's a friend of yours, Kent." But Kikuchi received
no answer. He looked at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> other, who had thrown himself in front of
the couch, leaning over the girl; then he tiptoed out of the room.</p>

<p>The girl had fallen into a stupor again. From outside a roaring crackle
became louder and louder. The windows crimsoned with vitreous red
glitter.</p>

<p>"Hugh-san," she was trying to raise her head, the voice faint, dreamy.
"See, sunrise over the mountains again; but I want to sleep some more,
I'm tired." Poor little girl, evidently her mind was back in Hakone.
"Hugh-san, sing some more," her hand falteringly sought his. "Sing the
'rock-a-by baby' song again."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, go to sleep, dear. You'll be all right presently; but now
you must just sleep." He smoothed her hair.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll sleep; but you must sing to me, Hugh-san." The weak voice
was insistent.</p>

<p>Sing! Must this damned grotesque inspiration pursue him even into
the shadow of death! It was monstrous, impossible, this necessity of
drooling nursery nonsense in the very shadow of racking tragedy. He
cleared his voice, contrived a croaking sound, choked, tried again,
managed it. Leaning forward over her, he intoned his miserable ditty.
"Rock-a-by, baby&mdash;&mdash;" he began even to find a sort of comfort in it,
the monotonous repetition of the meaningless stanzas; kept droning
them mechanically, endlessly,&mdash;"when the wind blows the cradle will
rock&mdash;&mdash;" The impression of a large, white hand on the girl's breast
just before him took form in his mind. He looked up. It was the new
doctor from St. Luke's.</p>

<p>"Unless you are singing for your own edification, Mr. Kent, you might
as well stop." The voice was cold, registered the young man's intense
disapproval. "This girl is dead, stone dead."</p>

<p>He stared. It was, of course, what he had expected;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> still the
announcement, the definite irrevocableness thereof stunned him. A
new figure, a woman's, came into the field of his vision. Sylvia. He
stretched out his hand to her.</p>

<p>They stood there, hand in hand, he and Sylvia, gazing at the dead girl.
"The poor, dear little thing." There were tears in the girl's voice.
"How beautiful she is."</p>

<p>"Beautiful." The thought came to him of the peculiarly luminous
radiance of her eyes. "That's just what makes me so sick of this
whole thing, Sylvia, the wanton waste and destruction of the process
of compelling the grace and beauty of Japan into the cramping forms
of our civilization: that it is these women, these girls who must
suffer. What do I care for the men, even the young boys, who have been
slaughtered to-day! That's part of the game, man's price for that which
we call progress of civilization. That's all right. But these girls,
these infinitely delicate and beautiful beings, made for sunlight, and
fragrance, and flowers; but they are drawn, attracted into the whirl
and whirr of the wheels of our civilization, and they hurt them, tear
and mangle them, in mind, in spirit, or in body, and cast them forth."
He stared misty-eyed at the figure before them, with its bright crimson
<i>obi</i> band, delicately tinted kimono sleeve drooping outspread towards
the floor. "Like that, dead, crushed&mdash;broken butterflies."</p>

<p>Outside, the tumult and clamor of the mob was increasing. All were
facing the palace gate at Sakuradamon. "<i>Banzai.</i>" The cry came from
those on the bridge. "<i>Banzai.</i> Long live the Emperor. Long live
Japan. <i>Banzai.</i>" The roar was taken up by the other thousands, rose
heavenwards, about the rumble and crackle from the flaming furnace of
the General Staff building. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>Kikuchi slammed open the window. "Come on," he turned to Kent,
ecstatic, strident-voiced. "We have won. The tyrants are finished.
Now we shall build up Japan, make it a great nation, the Emperor and
the people together. <i>Banzai.</i>" He threw his arm around the shoulder
of Ishii. Together they leaned far out of the window, aristocrat and
office boy, their voices blending with the thunderous pæan of the multitude:</p>

<p>"<i>Banzai, banzai.</i>"</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
